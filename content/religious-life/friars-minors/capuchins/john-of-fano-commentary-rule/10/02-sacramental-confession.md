Scrupulous Brother. – If a brother recognizes that he is weak and knows that he cannot confess without damaging his soul, is he obliged to obey when commanded?

Mature Brother. – The Four Masters and the Pisan say that when the superior knows this, he may not command the subject, and the subject is not obliged to obey, just as in other matters which are against his soul and the Rule. Saint Francis does not make any mention of confession in the Rule. When he dies, a brother will not be asked whether he had confessed but whether he has observed the Rule.

He who confesses does not have to go beyond what the law commands. Therefore, where the danger is great, it is better not to confess, as Saint Francis exhorted his brothers. See in the Conformities under the heading Franciscus praedicator.

This applies all the more to one who does not feel up to it. Ignorance, temerity, cupidity, and not wanting to displease are causes of very many evils in confession.

Saint Bonaventure says that not only what is against the soul but also what is near or incites to sin must be avoided.
