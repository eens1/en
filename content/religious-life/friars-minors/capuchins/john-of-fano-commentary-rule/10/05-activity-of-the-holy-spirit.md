677 Text: Let them pay attention to what they must desire above all else: to have the Spirit of the Lord and Its holy activity, to pray always to Him with a pure heart, to have humility and patience in persecution and infirmity, and to love those who persecute, rebuke, and find fault with us, because the Lord says: “Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute and calumniate you. Blessed are those who suffer persecution for the sake of justice, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. But whoever perseveres to the end will be saved.”

Mature Brother – Patience, humility, love of enemies, and other virtues are the activities of the Holy Spirit. To pray always and to always observe the spirit of prayer and devotion is the only way to implore the clemency of the Saviour with unmentionable sighs.
