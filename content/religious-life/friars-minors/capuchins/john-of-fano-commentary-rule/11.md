## Tact and watchfulness in dealing with women

[Mature Brother]. – […] Note that, as it is written in the Legenda Maggiore
Saint Francis commanded the brothers to most carefully avoid looking at and speaking with women, something which has been the occasion of ruin to many, stating that through this those who are weak have been broken and strength of spirit become infirm. It is just as likely that someone who converses with women will not be contaminated as it is, as Scripture says,
to walk through fire without being burnt. He did not regard it as being safe to keep images of women in mind as they might inflame the flesh with lust and stain the purity of the mind. When he feels too secure the enemy catches a person off guard, and if the devil finds as much as a hair of his own in a person he will quickly [128v] make it grow into a torrent. This is what Saint Francis said.
