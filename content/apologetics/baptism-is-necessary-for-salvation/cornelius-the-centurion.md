<p><strong><u>OBJECTION-</u></strong> Acts 10:47 says that Cornelius and his companions received the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; This means that they were justified without Baptism.</p>

<p><strong><u>ANSWER</u></strong><strong>- </strong>Acts 10:47 does not say that Cornelius and his companions were justified without Baptism.&nbsp; Nothing there says that their sins were remitted or that they were “saved,” a phrase frequently used to describe those who have been justified by Baptism.&nbsp; The context of Acts 10 is dealing with <em>receiving the Holy Ghost by receiving the gift of speaking in tongues</em>, not having one’s sins remitted.&nbsp; Acts 10:47, therefore, is merely speaking of Cornelius and his companions having received the gift of tongues.&nbsp; The description “receiving the Holy Ghost” or “being filled with the Holy Ghost” is actually used frequently in scripture to describe a person making a godly prophecy or receiving some spiritual gift.&nbsp; It does not necessarily mean that one has received the remission of sins.&nbsp; The following two passages are examples of the phrase “filled with the Holy Ghost” being used to describe a spiritual gift (prophesy, etc.), not the remission of sins.</p>
