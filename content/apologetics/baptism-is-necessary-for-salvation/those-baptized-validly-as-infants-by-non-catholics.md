<p>The Catholic Church has always taught that anyone (including a layman or a non-Catholic) can validly baptize if he adheres to proper matter and form and if he has the intention of doing what the Church does.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pope Eugene IV, Council of Florence, “Exultate Deo,” 1439: “In case of necessity, however, not only a priest or a deacon, but even a layman or woman, yes even a pagan and a heretic can baptize, so long as he preserves the form of the Church and has the intention of doing what the Church does.”<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Church has always taught that infants baptized in heretical and schismatic churches are made Catholics, members of the Church and subjects of the Roman Pontiff, even if the people who baptized them are heretics who are outside the Catholic Church.  This is because the infant, being below the age of reason, cannot be a heretic or schismatic.  He cannot have an impediment which would prevent Baptism from making him a member of the Church.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Paul III, Council of Trent, Sess. 7, Can. 13 on the Sacrament of Baptism:<br />“<strong>If anyone shall say that infants,</strong> because they have not actual faith, <strong>after having received baptism are not to be numbered among the faithful</strong>… let him be anathema.”<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means that all baptized infants wherever they are, even those baptized in heretical non-Catholic churches by heretical ministers, are made members of the Catholic Church.  They are also made subject to the Roman Pontiff (if there is one).  So, at what one point does this baptized Catholic infant become a non-Catholic – severing his membership in the Church and subjection to the Roman Pontiff?  After the baptized infant reaches the age of reason, he or she becomes a heretic or a schismatic and severs his membership in the Church and severs subjection to the Roman Pontiff <em>when he or she obstinately rejects <u>any</u> teaching of the Catholic Church or loses Faith in the essential mysteries of the Trinity and Incarnatio</em>n.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Clement VI, <em>Super quibusdam</em>, Sept. 20, 1351: “…We ask: <strong>In the first place whether you and the Church of the Armenians which is obedient to you, believe that <u>all those who in baptism have received the same Catholic faith</u>, <u>and afterwards have withdrawn and will withdraw in the future from the communion of this same Roman Church</u>, which one alone is Catholic,<u> are schismatic and heretical, if they remain obstinately separated from the faith of this Roman Church</u></strong>.  In the second place, we ask whether you and the Armenians obedient to you believe that no man of the wayfarers outside the faith of this Church, and outside the obedience of the Pope of Rome, can finally be saved.”<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[3]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, one must be clear on these points: 1) The unbaptized (Jews, Muslims, pagans, etc.) must all join the Catholic Church by receiving Baptism and the Catholic Faith or they will <em>all</em> be lost.  2)  Among those who are baptized as infants, they are made Catholics, members of the Church and subjects of the Roman Pontiff by Baptism.  They only sever that membership (<em>which they already possess</em>) when they obstinately reject any Catholic dogma or believe something contrary to the essential mysteries of the Trinity and Incarnation.  In the teaching of Pope Clement VI above, we see this second point clearly taught: all who receive the Catholic Faith in Baptism lose that Faith and become schismatic and heretical if they become “obstinately separated from the faith of this Roman Church.” </p>
<p>The fact is that all Protestants who reject the Catholic Church or its dogmas on the sacraments, the Papacy, etc. have obstinately separated from the Faith of the Roman Church and have therefore severed their membership in the Church of Christ.  The same is true with the “Eastern Orthodox” who obstinately reject dogmas on the Papacy and Papal Infallibility.  They need to be converted to the Catholic Faith for salvation.</p>
