title: There is only One Baptism, Not Three

<p>It is defined Catholic dogma that there is only one baptism.  This is why the dogmatic Nicene Creed, historically professed every Sunday in the Roman Rite, reads: “<em>I confess one baptism for the remission of sins</em>.”  And this dogma that there is one baptism for the remission of sins comes from Our Lord and the Apostles.  It is affirmed by St. Paul in Ephesians 4:5: “<em>One Lord, one faith, one baptism</em>.”  Could it be possible that there is more than one baptism for the remission of sins when Catholics have prayed and believed for 2000 years that there is only one?  No.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Pius XI, <em>Quas Primas</em> (# 12), Dec. 11, 1925: “The perfect harmony of the Eastern liturgies with our own in this continual praise of Christ the King shows once more the truth of the axiom: <em>Legem credendi lex statuit supplicandi</em>.  <strong>The rule of faith is indicated by the law of our worship.”</strong><a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Throughout history many popes have expressly reaffirmed this rule of faith: that there is only one baptism for the remission of sins.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The Nicene-Constantinople Creed</em>, 381, <em>ex cathedra</em>: “We confess <strong>one baptism</strong> <strong>for the remission of sins</strong>.”<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a></p>
<p>Pope St. Celestine I, <em>Council of Ephesus</em>, 431: “Having read these holy phrases and finding ourselves in agreement (for ‘there is one Lord, one faith,<strong> one baptism’</strong> [Eph. 4:5]), we have given glory to God who is the savior of all…”<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>Pope St. Leo IX, <em>Congratulamur Vehementer</em>, April 13, 1053: “I believe that the one true Church is holy, Catholic and apostolic, <strong>in</strong> <strong>which is given one baptism</strong> and the true remission of all sins.”<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4">[4]</a></p>
<p>Pope Boniface VIII, <em>Unam Sanctam</em>, Nov. 18, 1302, <strong><em>ex cathedra</em></strong>: “One is my dove, my perfect one… which represents the one mystical body whose head is Christ, of Christ indeed, as God.  And in this, ‘one Lord, one faith,<strong> one baptism</strong>’ (Eph. 4:5).”<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5">[5]</a></p>
<p>Pope Clement V, <em>Council of Vienne</em>, Decree # 30, 1311-1312, <strong><em>ex cathedra</em></strong>:  “Since however there is for both regulars and seculars, for superiors and subjects, for exempt and non-exempt, <strong><em>one universal Church, outside of which there is no salvation</em></strong>, for all of whom there is <em>one Lord, one faith, and<strong> one baptism</strong></em>…”<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6">[6]</a></p>
<p>Pope Pius VI, <em>Inscrutabile</em> (# 8), Dec. 25, 1775: “… We exhort and advise you to be all of one mind and in harmony as you strive for the same object, <strong>just as the Church has </strong>one faith,<strong> one baptism</strong>, and one spirit.”<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7">[7]</a></p>
<p>Pope Leo XII, <em>Ubi Primum</em> (# 14), May 5, 1824: “<strong>By it we are taught, and by divine faith we hold </strong>one Lord, one faith,<strong> one baptism</strong>, and that no other name under heaven is given to men except the name of Jesus Christ in which we must be saved.<strong>  This is why we profess that there is no salvation outside the Church.”</strong><a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8">[8]</a></p>
<p>Pope Pius VIII, <em>Traditi Humilitati</em> (# 4), May 24, 1829: “Against these experienced sophists the people must be taught that <strong>the profession of the Catholic faith is uniquely true</strong>, as the apostle proclaims: one Lord, one faith, <strong>one baptism (Eph. 4:5).”</strong><a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9">[9]</a></p>
<p>Pope Gregory XVI, <em>Mirari Vos</em> (# 13), Aug. 15, 1832: “With the admonition of the apostle that ‘there is one God, one faith, <strong>one baptism’ (Eph. 4:5</strong>) may those fear who contrive the notion that the safe harbor of salvation is open to persons of any religion whatever.”<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10">[10]</a></p>
<p>Pope Leo XIII, <em>Graves de communi re</em> (# 8), Jan. 18, 1901: “<strong>Hence the doctrine of the Apostle</strong>, who warns us that ‘We are one body and spirit called to the one hope in our vocation; one Lord, one faith and <strong>one baptism</strong>…”<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11">[11]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To say that there are “three baptisms,” as many unfortunately do, is heretical.  There is only one baptism, which is celebrated in water (<em>de fide</em>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Clement V, <em>Council of Vienne</em>, 1311-1312, <strong><em>ex cathedra</em></strong>:  “Besides, <strong><u>one baptism</u></strong> which regenerates all who are baptized in Christ <strong><u>must be faithfully confessed by all</u></strong> just as ‘one God and one faith’ [Eph. 4:5], <strong><u>which celebrated in water</u> </strong>in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit we believe to be commonly the perfect remedy for salvation for adults as for children.”<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12">[12]</a>     </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here Pope Clement V defines as a dogma that ONE BAPTISM must be faithfully confessed by all, <strong>which is celebrated in water</strong>.  This means that all Catholics must profess one baptism of water, not three baptisms: of water, blood and desire.  To confess “three baptisms,” and not one, is to contradict defined Catholic dogma.  Did those who believe that there are three baptisms (water, blood and desire) ever wonder why countless popes have professed that there is only one baptism, and not a single one of them bothered to tell us about the so-called “other two”?</p>
