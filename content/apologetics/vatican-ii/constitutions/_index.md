  The Council of Florence dogmatically defined that any individual who has a view contrary to the Catholic Church’s teaching on Our Lord Jesus Christ or the Trinity, or any one of the truths about Our Lord or the Trinity, is rejected by God.
  
  > Pope Eugene IV, Council of Florence, Bull *Cantate Domino*, 1442, *ex cathedra*: “…the holy Roman Church, founded on the words of our Lord and Savior, firmly believes, professes and preaches one true God, almighty, immutable and eternal, **Father, Son and Holy Spirit… Therefore it [the Holy Roman Church] condemns, <u>rejects</u>, anathematizes and declares to be outside the Body of Christ, which is the Church, <u>whoever holds opposing or contrary views</u>**.” [2]
  
  This is an infallible dogmatic definition of the Catholic Church on <u>individuals</u> who have a view on Our Lord Jesus Christ or the Holy Trinity that is contrary to that of the Church (e.g., Jews, Muslims, etc.). The Council of Florence solemnly defines that whoever has a view contrary to the Church’s teaching on Our Lord and the Trinity (e.g., the Jews) is condemned and <u>rejected</u>! Note: the Council is not merely saying that the view contrary to Our Lord is rejected, but that <u>the individual</u> (e.g., the Jew) is <u>rejected</u>. This dogma is rooted in the truth that Our Lord specifically revealed in Sacred Scripture.
  
  > Matthew 10:33- “But **he that shall deny me before men, I will also deny before my Father who is in heaven**.”
  
  The word “deny” means to reject or to repudiate. He who denies Our Lord is rejected by Him. But in its *Decree on Non-Christian religions*, Vatican II taught just the opposite.
  
  > Vatican II Declaration, Nostra Aetate (#4): “Although the Church is the new people of God, **<u>the Jews should not be presented as rejected</u>** or cursed **by God**, as if such views followed from the holy scriptures.” [3]
  
  Vatican II denied the divinely revealed truth of Matthew 10:33, which was solemnly defined by the Council of Florence. The teaching of Vatican II is blatantly heretical.
  
  But it gets even worse when one considers this in more detail. In case you have any doubt about this heresy, please consider the following:
  
  
  > *Nostra Aetate* #4 of Vatican II: “…<u>the Jews should not be presented as rejected</u> or cursed by God...”
  
  > Vatican II, *Nostra Aetate* #4, Original Latin: “…Iudaei tamen neque ut a Deo **<u>reprobati</u>** neque ut maledicti exhibeantur…” [4]
  
  > Dogmatic Council of Florence: “Therefore it [<u>the Church</u>] condemns, <u>rejects</u>, anathematizes and declares to be outside the Body of Christ, which is the Church, <u>whoever holds opposing or contrary views</u>.”
  
  > The Latin of the Council of Florence: “Quoscunque ergo adversa et contraria sentientes damnat, **<u>reprobat</u>** et anathematizat et a Christi corpore, quod est ecclesia, alienos esse denuntiat.” [5]
  
  In making the infallible dogmatic declaration that all who have a view contrary to faith in Our Lord or the Trinity are rejected, **the original Latin of the Council of Florence uses the word “reprobat,” which means “rejects.”** It is from the Latin verb reprobo, which means “I reject” or “condemn.”
  
  But here’s the bombshell: In *Nostra Aetate* #4 (Vatican II’s Decree on Non-Christian Religions) to declare exactly the opposite, Vatican II uses the same verb! Vatican II uses “reprobati,” **which is the past participle passive of reprobo – the very same verb that the Council of Florence used!  This means that Vatican II and the Council of Florence are talking about the exact same thing – they use the exact same verb – <u>and they teach exactly the opposite</u>!** The Catholic Church defines that all individuals (Jews, etc.) who have a view contrary to Faith in Christ or the Trinity the Church “*reprobat*” (rejects). Vatican II tells us that the Jews should not be considered as “reprobati” (as having been rejected). Vatican II could hardly contradict Catholic dogma any more precisely!
  
  There can be absolutely no doubt that Vatican II denies the dogmatic teaching of the Council of Florence. Although there are many blatant heresies in Vatican II, as we will see, this is the most specific one. Anyone who would deny that Vatican II teaches heresy, in light of these facts, is simply a liar.
  
  This heresy in Vatican II’s Declaration *Nostra Aetate* is the theological foundation for the Vatican II sect’s current teaching on the Jews. It is the reason that the Vatican currently publishes books which teach that the Jews are perfectly free to live as if Christ had not come. It is the reason that the Vatican II sect teaches that the Old Covenant is valid. It is the reason why John Paul II and Benedict XVI both made trips to the Synagogue to attempt to validate the Jewish religion, as we will see.

> Yves Marsaudon, 33rd degree Scottish Rite Freemason, 1965: “… the courageous idea of liberty of thought… **– one can speak truly here of a revolution that has come from our Masonic lodges – has magnificently spread its wings over the dome of St. Peter’s**.” [1] 

Vatican II was a council that took place from 1962-1965. Vatican II was a false council that constituted a revolution against 2000 years of Catholic teaching and Tradition. Vatican II contains many heresies that were directly condemned by past popes and infallible councils, as we will see. Vatican II attempted to give Catholics a new religion. In the period following Vatican II, massive changes in every aspect of Catholic Faith ensued, including the implementation of a New Mass.

Vatican II also came out with new practices and views toward other religions. The Catholic Church cannot change its teaching on other religions and how it views the members of other religions, since these are truths of Faith delivered by Jesus Christ. Vatican II attempted to change those truths of the Catholic Church.

Vatican II was called by John XXIII, and it was solemnly promulgated and confirmed by Paul VI on Dec. 8, 1965. Vatican II was not a true general or ecumenical council of the Catholic Church because, as we will see in detail, it was called and confirmed by manifest heretics (John XXIII and Paul VI) who were not eligible for the papal election (see Paul IV’s Apostolic Constitution above). The fruits of Vatican II are plain for all to see. Any honest Catholic who lived before the council and compares it with the religion in the dioceses today can attest to the fact that Vatican II inaugurated a new religion.

## The Most Specific Heresy in Vatican II

### Vatican II uses the same verb as the Council of Florence to teach just the opposite 

The Council of Florence dogmatically defined that any individual who has a view contrary to the Catholic Church’s teaching on Our Lord Jesus Christ or the Trinity, or any one of the truths about Our Lord or the Trinity, is rejected by God.

> Pope Eugene IV, Council of Florence, Bull *Cantate Domino*, 1442, *ex cathedra*: “…the holy Roman Church, founded on the words of our Lord and Savior, firmly believes, professes and preaches one true God, almighty, immutable and eternal, **Father, Son and Holy Spirit… Therefore it [the Holy Roman Church] condemns, <u>rejects</u>, anathematizes and declares to be outside the Body of Christ, which is the Church, <u>whoever holds opposing or contrary views</u>**.” [2]

This is an infallible dogmatic definition of the Catholic Church on <u>individuals</u> who have a view on Our Lord Jesus Christ or the Holy Trinity that is contrary to that of the Church (e.g., Jews, Muslims, etc.). The Council of Florence solemnly defines that whoever has a view contrary to the Church’s teaching on Our Lord and the Trinity (e.g., the Jews) is condemned and <u>rejected</u>! Note: the Council is not merely saying that the view contrary to Our Lord is rejected, but that <u>the individual</u> (e.g., the Jew) is <u>rejected</u>. This dogma is rooted in the truth that Our Lord specifically revealed in Sacred Scripture.

> Matthew 10:33- “But **he that shall deny me before men, I will also deny before my Father who is in heaven**.”

The word “deny” means to reject or to repudiate. He who denies Our Lord is rejected by Him. But in its *Decree on Non-Christian religions*, Vatican II taught just the opposite.

> Vatican II Declaration, Nostra Aetate (#4): “Although the Church is the new people of God, **<u>the Jews should not be presented as rejected</u>** or cursed **by God**, as if such views followed from the holy scriptures.” [3]

Vatican II denied the divinely revealed truth of Matthew 10:33, which was solemnly defined by the Council of Florence. The teaching of Vatican II is blatantly heretical.

But it gets even worse when one considers this in more detail. In case you have any doubt about this heresy, please consider the following:

### Vatican II vs. The Dogmatic Council of Florence

> *Nostra Aetate* #4 of Vatican II: “…<u>the Jews should not be presented as rejected</u> or cursed by God...”

> Vatican II, *Nostra Aetate* #4, Original Latin: “…Iudaei tamen neque ut a Deo **<u>reprobati</u>** neque ut maledicti exhibeantur…” [4]

> Dogmatic Council of Florence: “Therefore it [<u>the Church</u>] condemns, <u>rejects</u>, anathematizes and declares to be outside the Body of Christ, which is the Church, <u>whoever holds opposing or contrary views</u>.”

> The Latin of the Council of Florence: “Quoscunque ergo adversa et contraria sentientes damnat, **<u>reprobat</u>** et anathematizat et a Christi corpore, quod est ecclesia, alienos esse denuntiat.” [5]

In making the infallible dogmatic declaration that all who have a view contrary to faith in Our Lord or the Trinity are rejected, **the original Latin of the Council of Florence uses the word “reprobat,” which means “rejects.”** It is from the Latin verb reprobo, which means “I reject” or “condemn.”

But here’s the bombshell: In *Nostra Aetate* #4 (Vatican II’s Decree on Non-Christian Religions) to declare exactly the opposite, Vatican II uses the same verb! Vatican II uses “reprobati,” **which is the past participle passive of reprobo – the very same verb that the Council of Florence used!  This means that Vatican II and the Council of Florence are talking about the exact same thing – they use the exact same verb – <u>and they teach exactly the opposite</u>!** The Catholic Church defines that all individuals (Jews, etc.) who have a view contrary to Faith in Christ or the Trinity the Church “*reprobat*” (rejects). Vatican II tells us that the Jews should not be considered as “reprobati” (as having been rejected). Vatican II could hardly contradict Catholic dogma any more precisely!

There can be absolutely no doubt that Vatican II denies the dogmatic teaching of the Council of Florence. Although there are many blatant heresies in Vatican II, as we will see, this is the most specific one. Anyone who would deny that Vatican II teaches heresy, in light of these facts, is simply a liar.

This heresy in Vatican II’s Declaration *Nostra Aetate* is the theological foundation for the Vatican II sect’s current teaching on the Jews. It is the reason that the Vatican currently publishes books which teach that the Jews are perfectly free to live as if Christ had not come. It is the reason that the Vatican II sect teaches that the Old Covenant is valid. It is the reason why John Paul II and Benedict XVI both made trips to the Synagogue to attempt to validate the Jewish religion, as we will see.
