<p>Answer: The Joint Declaration with the Lutherans by itself proves that the Vatican II “popes” are non-Catholic antipopes.  The fact that John Paul II and Benedict XVI neither wrote the document nor signed it is completely irrelevant.  <strong><u>They both approved of it publicly numerous times</u></strong>, and agreed with it. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>John Paul II, Jan. 19, 2004, <em>At a Meeting with Lutherans From Finland</em>: “… I wish to express my gratitude for the ecumenical progress made between Catholics and Lutherans in the five years <strong><u>since the signing of the <em>Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification</em></u></strong>.”<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>Address to Protestants at World Youth Da</em>y, August 19, 2005: “…<strong> the important Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification (1999)</strong> …<strong>”<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>James Smith could draw up a document denying the Immaculate Conception, and if you were to go around giving speeches about how great Smith’s document is, that would make you a manifest heretic.  The fact that you didn’t write Smith’s document or sign it means nothing; you publicly approved of it.  John Paul II and Benedict XVI publicly approved of the <em>Joint Declaration with the Lutherans on Justification</em>, which teaches that the worst Lutheran heresies are not condemned by the Council of Trent.  They are manifest heretics.</p>
