<blockquote>
<p>Pope Vigilius, <em>Second Council of Constantinople</em>, 553: “… we bear in mind what was promised about the holy Church and Him who said <strong><em>the gates of Hell will not prevail against it</em></strong> <strong>(<u>by these we understand the death-dealing tongues of heretics</u>)</strong>…” (<em>Decrees of the Ecumenical Councils</em>, Sheed &amp; Ward and Georgetown University Press, 1990, Vol. 1, p. 113.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are many objections launched against the sedevacantist position – that is, the position expounded in this book according to which the Chair of St. Peter is vacant because the post-Vatican II “popes” are not true popes, but non-Catholic antipopes.  We will now address all of the major objections that are launched against this position.</p>

<p>We have addressed in much detail the major objections launched against the sedevacantist position.  We can see that there is nothing in the teaching of the Catholic Church which should cause one not to accept the undeniable fact that the Vatican II sect is not the Catholic Church, and that the men who have headed this sect (the post-Vatican II “popes”) are not popes at all, but non-Catholic antipopes.  On the contrary, there is undeniable proof for this position and every reason to accept it.</p>
