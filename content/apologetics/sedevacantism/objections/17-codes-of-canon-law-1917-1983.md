<blockquote>
<p>Chris Ferrara, ”A Challenge to the Sedevacantist Enterprise, Part II,” <em>The Remnant</em>, Sept. 30, 2005, p. 18: “<strong>Indeed, <u>both the 1917 and 1983 codes</u> of canon law provide that no one may insist that an ecclesiastical office has been lost due to heresy unless this has been established by a declaration of the competent authority</strong>.”<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Answer: This is simply not true.  Antipope John Paul II’s heretical and invalid 1983 Code states that such a declaration is necessary in Canon 194 § 3.  But the 1917 Code doesn’t.  The 1917 Code’s parallel canon to canon 194 is canon 188.  <strong>Canon 188 of the 1917 Code does not contain this provision</strong>, but simply declares that a cleric who “Publicly defects from the Catholic faith” (188 § 4) loses his office by that very fact “without any declaration.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Canon 188.4, <em>1917 Code of Canon Law:<br /></em><em>“</em>There are certain causes which effect the tacit (silent) resignation of an office, <strong>which resignation is accepted in advance by operation of the law, and hence is effective <u>without any declaration</u></strong>.  These causes are… (4) <u>if he has publicly fallen away from the faith.</u>”<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice that the 1917 Code doesn’t say anything about a declaration being necessary; it says just the opposite – “without any declaration”!  When one compares the two canons, one sees the glaring difference. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Canon 194.1-3, <em>1983 Code of Canon Law: “</em>One is removed from an ecclesiastical office by the law itself: ... 2- who has publicly defected from the Catholic faith or from the communion of the Church… The removal from office referred to in nn. 2 and 3 can be enforced <u>only if it is established by the declaration of a competent authority</u>.”<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[3]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is probably why Ferrara provides no citation to the 1917 Code in his footnote; he only provides a reference to the 1983 code.  Thus, we are dealing with <u>another blatant falsehood from Ferrara</u>.</p>
