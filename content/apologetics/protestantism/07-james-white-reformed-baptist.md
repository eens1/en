This is a new video. The first part of this video covers what is probably the best argument that has been made against the Reformed Protestant position of justification by faith alone. This argument was originally released and contained in our documentary on justification (which also dealt with many other related matters). However, this new video delves into and examines more angles of the argument. It further demonstrates that there is no way around it, and explains why it’s so powerful. It also examines an attempted response that was made to one aspect of this argument. It shows how that response failed miserably. After covering these very important points, which are relevant to what’s covered later in the video, the video moves into a shocking spiritual exposé of Dr. James White (a prominent Reformed Protestant apologist and speaker who is very anti-Catholic).
