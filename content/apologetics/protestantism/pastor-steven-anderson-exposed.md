This video, although it focuses primarily on one man, covers many extremely important topics that are relevant to multitudes. Thus we strongly encourage people to watch all of it. Note that one section of this video (from 1:23:36 to 1:45:41) is the video that we previously posted called Mary: Mother Of God & Ark Of The New Covenant. If you’ve already seen that video, and you come to that section in this video and wish to pass over it, note that the new content resumes at the 1:45:41 mark. Further, you don’t want to miss the final sections of this video. They are very revealing; but to recognize their full significance one needs to see the rest of the video, which covers many important topics.
