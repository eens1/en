<h2><a id="Sitteth1" name="Sitteth1"></a><strong>1.&nbsp; Our Lady Prophesied that </strong><strong>Rome</strong><strong> will become the Seat of Antichrist</strong></h2>
<p>As we’ve seen, on Sept. 19, 1846, the Blessed Virgin Mary appeared in La Salette, France, and foretold that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“<em>Rome will lose the faith and become the Seat of the Antichrist… the Church will be in eclipse</em>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our Lady specifically predicted that Rome would lose the Catholic faith, fall into apostasy from the true Church of Christ and become the Seat of the Antichrist.&nbsp; But what is antichrist?</p>
<p><a href="#menu"><span class="st">↑</span>Go back to menu</a></p>

<h2><a id="defined2" name="defined2"></a><strong>2.&nbsp; Antichrist defined </strong></h2>
<p>In all of Sacred Scripture, the word <em>antichrist </em>is only mentioned four times.&nbsp; The word <em>antichrist</em> is not mentioned at all in the Apocalypse and it is not mentioned by St. Paul (who only uses the terms “son of perdition” and “man of sin”).&nbsp; The word <em>antichrist</em> is only mentioned by St. John the Apostle in his epistles.</p>
<p>Therefore, in looking for the definition of <em>Antichrist</em>, we must first look to St. John’s epistles, not the Apocalypse; for St. John uses and defines the word <em>Antichrist </em>and the Apocalypse does not.&nbsp; Out of the four times that St. John uses the word <em>Antichrist</em>, he only defines it twice.&nbsp; The two definitions that St. John gives for Antichrist are the most important pieces of evidence that exist in identifying who the Antichrist actually is, because Sacred Scripture is the inspired, infallible and inerrant Word of God.&nbsp; Therefore, Sacred Scripture’s definition of Antichrist is infallibly the correct one.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1 John 2:22 – “Who is a liar, but <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">he who denieth that Jesus is the Christ?&nbsp; He is antichrist</span></strong>, who denieth the Father, and the Son.”</p>
<p>1 John 4:2-3 – “Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is of God: <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">And every spirit that dissolveth Jesus is not of God: and this is Antichrist</span></strong>, of whom you have heard that he cometh...”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both definitions of Antichrist deal with a denial of the truth about <em>who Jesus Christ is</em>.&nbsp; The truth about Our Lord Jesus Christ and the truth about the Most Holy Trinity are the very foundations of the Christian religion.&nbsp; They are the most important truths in the universe.</p>
<p>This is why the early councils of the Catholic Church condemned with the utmost vigor even the slightest deviation from the truth about Jesus Christ or the Trinity.&nbsp; And this is why the greatest enemies of Jesus Christ in history were not those men who caused Christ’s followers temporal harm, but those who were most effective and blasphemous in attacking the truth about Jesus Christ – which is the very foundation of one’s eternal salvation.</p>
<p>Thus, in defining “Antichrist,” <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sacred Scripture refers to a specific attack on the truth about Jesus Christ, a specific attack on the truth about the God-man</span>.&nbsp; Sacred Scripture refers specifically to the dissolving of Jesus (1 John 4:2-3) and the denial that Jesus is the Christ (1 John 2:22).&nbsp; These two things serve as the distinguishing characteristic of the Antichrist, according to Sacred Scripture, and these two things clearly refer to an attack on the truth of the Incarnation of the Son of God.</p>
<p>One of the first and most notorious men in Church history to pervert the doctrine of the Incarnation was the 5th century heretic Nestorius, who was condemned by the Council of Ephesus in 431.&nbsp; The case of the heretic Nestorius is very important in identifying the Antichrist and how it has overtaken the Vatican, as we will see, because Nestorius’s heresy was the specific heresy which fits the Bible’s definition for Antichrist.</p>
<p>Nestorius was the heretic who tried to dissolve Jesus (1 John 4:2-3), and he did so by perverting the truth of the Incarnation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pope Pius XI, <em>Lux Veritatis </em>(# 37), Dec. 25, 1931: “…all these, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">no less than Nestorius, make a temerarious attempt to ‘DISSOLVE CHRIST,’</span></strong>...”<a id="_ednref3" title="" href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[3]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pope Pius XI here confirms that Nestorius’s heresy was the specific doctrine of Antichrist – it was an attempt to dissolve the Person of Jesus Christ, which is the mark of Antichrist, according to Scripture.&nbsp; Keep this fact in mind (that Nestorius’s doctrine of the “dissolving of Jesus” was the specific doctrine of Antichrist as described by Sacred Scripture), as it will become especially relevant soon.</p>
<p>But what was this doctrine of Nestorius?&nbsp; How did Nestorius “DISSOLVE” Jesus and in so doing become what St. John defines as “Antichrist”?&nbsp; In order to understand Nestorius’s doctrine, we must very briefly repeat the Catholic truth of the Incarnation.</p>
<p>The Catholic Church teaches that the eternal Word – the Son of God – the Second Person of the Most Holy Trinity – assumed a human nature and truly became a man.&nbsp; St. John 1:14: “<em>And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us</em>.”</p>
<p>Our Lord Jesus Christ is the eternal Word made flesh.&nbsp; He is truly God and He is also truly man.&nbsp; <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">He is one Christ</span></strong> – One Divine Person with two natures.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pope St. Leo the Great, <em>Council of Chalcedon</em>, 451, ex cathedra: <em>“… </em>we all with one voice teach the confession of one and same Son, our Lord Jesus Christ: the same perfect in divinity and perfect in humanity, the same truly God and truly man, of a rational soul and a body… one and same Christ… a single person and subsistent being; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">He is not parted or divided into two persons</span>, but is one and the same only-begotten Son, God, Word, Lord Jesus Christ…”<a id="_ednref4" title="" href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4">[4]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Nestorius rejected that Our Lord Jesus Christ is one person.&nbsp; Nestorius blasphemously dissolved Jesus into two persons.&nbsp; Nestorius blasphemously held that the Son of God did not become man in the Incarnation, but rather that the Son of God united himself in a certain way with a man named Jesus.</p>

<p>Antipope John Paul II, <em>Redemptor</em><em> Hominis </em>#13, March 4, 1979: “… by his Incarnation, he, <strong>the Son of God, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in a certain way united himself with EACH MAN</span>.”</strong><a id="_ednref5" title="" href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5"><strong><strong>[5]</strong></strong></a></p>
<p>Antipope John Paul II, <em>Homily</em>, July 2, 1986: <strong>“… the Son of God</strong>, incarnate in the womb of the Virgin Mary, <strong>‘has in a certain way united himself with each man.’”</strong><a id="_ednref6" title="" href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6"><strong><strong>[6]</strong></strong></a></p>
<p>Antipope John Paul II, <em>Homily</em>, April 8, 1987: “… <strong>by his incarnation the Son of God has united himself in a certain way with EACH PERSON</strong>.”<a id="_ednref7" title="" href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7">[7]</a></p>
<p>Antipope John Paul II, <em>Letter to Families</em> (# 2): “<strong>…</strong> <strong>the Son of God, who in the Incarnation ‘united himself in some sense with every man.’”</strong><a id="_ednref8" title="" href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8"><strong><strong>[8]</strong></strong></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And by holding that the Son of God did not become man, but rather <span style="text-decoration: underline;">united Himself with a man named Jesus in the Incarnation</span>, Nestorius dissolved or divided Our Lord Jesus Christ into two persons.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pope St. Leo the Great, Dogmatic Letter to Flavian, 449: “Let Nestorius, therefore, be anathematized…<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> he made one person of the flesh, and another of the Godhead, AND DID NOT PERCEIVE THAT THERE WAS BUT ONE CHRIST</span>…”</strong><a id="_ednref9" title="" href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9"><strong><strong>[9]</strong></strong></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And by dissolving or dividing Our Lord Jesus Christ into two persons, Nestorius’s Antichrist doctrine logically resulted in the worship of two Christs, and introduced, as a consequence, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THE WORSHIP OF MAN!</span></strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pope Vigilius, <em>Second Council of Constantinople</em>, 553: “<strong>The holy synod of Ephesus… has pronounced sentence against the heresy of Nestorius</strong>… and all those who might later… adopt the same opinions as he held… They express these falsehoods against the true dogmas of the Church, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">OFFERING WORSHIP TO TWO SONS</span></strong>, trying to divide that which cannot be divided, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">AND INTRODUCING TO BOTH HEAVEN AND EARTH THE OFFENCE OF THE WORSHIP OF MAN</span></strong>.&nbsp; But the sacred band of heavenly spirits worship along with us only one Lord Jesus Christ.”<a id="_ednref10" title="" href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10">[10]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this incredible quotation, the dogmatic <em>Second Council of Constantinople</em> teaches that the blasphemous dissolving of Jesus into two persons by Nestorius’s view of the Incarnation, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">resulted in the worship of two sons</span>, and introduced as a consequence <strong>THE WORSHIP OF MAN</strong>.&nbsp; We repeat, <strong>NESTORIUS’S HERETICAL VIEW OF THE INCARNATION RESULTED IN THE WORSHIP OF TWO SONS, AND INTRODUCED, AS A CONSEQUENCE, THE WORSHIP OF MAN</strong>.&nbsp; <strong>This was the very doctrine described by St. John as the doctrine of the Antichrist.</strong>&nbsp; Does it sound familiar?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Antipope John Paul II, <em>Redemptor</em><em> Hominis</em> (# 10), March 4, 1979: <strong>“IN REALITY, THE NAME FOR THAT DEEP AMAZEMENT AT <span style="text-decoration: underline;">MAN’S WORTH AND DIGNITY IS THE GOSPEL, THAT IS TO SAY: THE GOOD NEWS.&nbsp; IT IS ALSO CALLED CHRISTIANITY</span>.”</strong><a id="_ednref11" title="" href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11"><strong><strong>[11]</strong></strong></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, Antipope John Paul II preached the heresy of Nestorius – the very doctrine of the Antichrist.&nbsp; He preached the dissolving of Jesus in the Incarnation, which results in the worship of multiple Christs and the worship of man!</p>
<p>Here, in his very first encyclical, <em>Redemptor</em><em> Hominis</em>, Antipope John Paul II explicitly defined the Gospel, the Good News and Christianity as the deep amazement at man.&nbsp; <strong>The Gospel is the Life of Jesus Christ!&nbsp; </strong>By saying that the deep amazement at each man is the Gospel, the Good News and Christianity, Antipope John Paul II indicated that each man is Jesus Christ whom Christians worship.&nbsp; And this worship of each man as Christ <span style="text-decoration: underline;">springs from Antipope John Paul II’s teaching that the Son of God united Himself with each man in the Incarnation</span>!</p>
<p>Furthermore, while the similarity between Nestorius and Antipope John Paul II is undeniable, there is a crucial difference between the two.&nbsp; There is a crucial difference between the preliminary Antichrist, Nestorius, and Antipope John Paul II, whose doctrine represents the fulfillment of Our Lady’s prophecy that Rome will become the Seat of the Antichrist.&nbsp; The difference is that Antipope John Paul II’s preaching was six billion times worse.&nbsp; Nestorius dissolved Jesus into two (resulting in the worship of two Christs), while Antipope John Paul II dissolved Jesus into six billion, which resulted in the worship of six billion Christs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Antipope John Paul II, <em>General Audience</em>, Jan. 25, 1984: “<strong>Christ, the Son of God, by becoming flesh, assumes the humanity of every man</strong>… <span style="text-decoration: underline;">At this point he becomes united with every person</span>… <strong>In the Encyclical <em>Redemptor</em><em> Hominis</em> I wrote that ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline;">the name for that deep amazement at man’s worth and dignity is the Gospel, that is to say, the Good News.&nbsp; It is also called Christianity</span>.’”</strong><a id="_ednref12" title="" href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12"><strong><strong>[12]</strong></strong></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here we have Antipope John Paul II illustrating his dissolving of Jesus (his doctrine of the Antichrist) and his worship of man with cause and effect precision.&nbsp; He tells us that because the Son of God was united with each man in the Incarnation, that is, because the Son of God<strong> was dissolved into each man in the Incarnation, </strong>the name for <strong>Christianity is the deep amazement at each man</strong>; because by virtue of that event, every man is Jesus Christ.&nbsp; Every man is truly Son of God and truly man.&nbsp; We will prove in this article that this doctrine of the Antichrist, that each man became the Son of God in the Incarnation and is therefore Jesus Christ, is what Antipope John Paul II preached to the world.</p>

<h3><a id="takepossession3" name="takepossession3"></a><strong>3.&nbsp; Each man must take possession of the Incarnation</strong></h3>
<p>Just prior to defining Christianity as the deep amazement at man in his first encyclical <em>Redemptor</em><em> Hominis</em>, Antipope John Paul II wrote the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Antipope John Paul II, <em>Redemptor</em><em> Hominis</em> (# 10): <strong>“The man who wishes to understand himself thoroughly</strong>… <strong>he must ‘appropriate’ and assimilate the whole of the reality of the Incarnation </strong>and Redemption<strong> in order to find himself.&nbsp; </strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">If this profound process takes place within him, he then bears fruit not only of adoration of God but also of deep wonder at himself</span>.<strong>”</strong><a id="_ednref13" title="" href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13"><strong><strong>[13]</strong></strong></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To appropriate something is to “<em>take possession of it</em>.”<a id="_ednref14" title="" href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14">[14]</a>&nbsp; To assimilate something is to absorb it.&nbsp; Therefore, Antipope John Paul II is saying here that man must take possession of the Incarnation (that is, he must take possession of the fact that God became man) in order to find himself.&nbsp; This means that man must understand that he is a God-man in order to find himself.</p>
<p>When this happens in man, according to Antipope John Paul II, man will not only possess adoration of God, “but also of deep wonder at himself,” because he will learn that he too is Christ, the Son of God who has become man.&nbsp; This is why Antipope John Paul II defined Christianity as the deep amazement at each man in the very next paragraph of this encyclical (quoted already).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Antipope John Paul II, <em>Redemptor</em><em> Hominis</em> (# 10), March 4, 1979: “The man who wishes to understand himself thoroughly… <strong>he must ‘appropriate’ and assimilate the whole of the reality of the Incarnation</strong> and Redemption in order to find himself… IN REALITY, THE NAME FOR <strong>THAT DEEP AMAZEMENT AT <span style="text-decoration: underline;">MAN’S WORTH AND DIGNITY IS THE GOSPEL</span></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">, THAT IS TO SAY: THE GOOD NEWS.&nbsp; IT IS ALSO CALLED CHRISTIANITY</span>.”<a id="_ednref15" title="" href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15">[15]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moreover, Antipope John Paul II repeated his important message (about taking possession of the Incarnation in order to find man) numerous times in his writings (<em>Catechesi</em><em> Tradendae</em> # 61;<em> Veritatis Splendor</em> # 8), since, as we have already shown, it is the foundation for the entire Gospel of Antichrist.</p>
<p>So at least three times in his writings, Antipope John Paul II taught that man must take possession of the Incarnation in order to find himself.&nbsp; And immediately after the first time he mentions this in <em>Redemptor</em><em> Hominis</em>, Antipope John Paul II confirms his real meaning by defining Christianity as the deep amazement at each man, confirming that this worship of each man flows directly from the Incarnation.</p>

<h3><a id="GoodNews4" name="GoodNews4"></a><a id="_4.__The_Gospel_is_the_Good_News_of_" name="_4.__The_Gospel_is_the_Good_News_of_"></a><strong>4.&nbsp; The Gospel is the Good News of man</strong></h3>
<p>Antipope John Paul II defined the Gospel as the deep amazement at man in his first encyclical and numerous other times.&nbsp; But Antipope John Paul II also defined the Gospel as the Good News of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; He defined it both ways because his message was that every man <em>is</em> Jesus Christ.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Antipope John Paul II, <em>Address</em>, March 7, 1983: “<em>The Gospel is a person</em>: it is Jesus Christ.”<a id="_ednref16" title="" href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16">[16]</a></p>
<p>Antipope John Paul II, <em>Homily</em>, June 1, 1980: “Not only is the Gospel message addressed to man, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">but it is a great Messianic message about man</span>; it is the revelation to man of the complete truth about himself…”<a id="_ednref17" title="" href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17">[17]</a></p>
<p>Antipope John Paul II, <em>Redemptoris</em><em> Missio</em> (# 13): <strong>“Jesus himself is the ‘Good News,’</strong> … <strong>he proclaims the ‘Good News’ not just by what he says or does, but by what he is.”</strong><a id="_ednref18" title="" href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18"><strong><strong>[18]</strong></strong></a></p>
<p>Antipope John Paul II, <em>Homily</em>, June 4, 1997: “<strong>The Gospel, by proclaiming the Good News of Jesus, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">announces also the Good News of man</span></strong>…”<a id="_ednref19" title="" href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19">[19]</a></p>
<p>Antipope John Paul II, <em>On Christ’s Lay Faithful </em>&nbsp;(# 7), Dec. 30, 1988: “…<strong><em>Jesus Christ himself, is the ‘good news’</em></strong><em>..</em>.”<a id="_ednref20" title="" href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20">[20]</a></p>
<p>Antipope John Paul II, <em>Homily</em>, May 9, 1988: <strong>“The Gospel is the revelation of God</strong>…&nbsp; <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">And it is also the revelation of the truth about man</span>, about his dignity… We call it Good News or ‘Good Tidings’…”</strong><a id="_ednref21" title="" href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21"><strong><strong>[21]</strong></strong></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Antipope John Paul II preached to the world that man and Jesus are one and the same, and that the Gospel is the truth about Jesus <em>and also</em> the truth about each man.&nbsp; The next quotation, in fact, is particularly revealing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Antipope John Paul II, <em>Address to Members of U.S. Congress</em>, Jan. 8, 2001: “In the years of my ministry, but especially in the Jubilee Year just ended, I have invited all to <strong>turn to Jesus in order <em>to discover in new and deeper ways the truth of man</em></strong> …&nbsp; <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">To see the truth of Christ is to experience with deep amazement the worth and dignity of every human bein</span>g, which is the Good News of the Gospel</strong> … (cf. Redemptor Hominis, n. 10).”<a id="_ednref22" title="" href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22">[22]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>First of all, notice the reference to <em>Redemptor</em><em> Hominis </em>10 that Antipope John Paul II made.&nbsp; <em>Redemptor</em><em> Hominis</em> 10 is where Antipope John Paul II originally defined the Gospel and Christianity as the deep amazement at man.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Antipope John Paul II, <em>Redemptor</em><em> Hominis</em> (# 10), March 4, 1979: <strong>“IN REALITY, THE NAME FOR THAT DEEP AMAZEMENT AT <span style="text-decoration: underline;">MAN’S WORTH AND DIGNITY IS THE GOSPEL, THAT IS TO SAY: THE GOOD NEWS.&nbsp; IT IS ALSO CALLED CHRISTIANITY</span>.”</strong><a id="_ednref23" title="" href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23"><strong><strong>[23]</strong></strong></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Secondly, just before giving that reference, Antipope John Paul II says that to see the truth of Christ is to experience with deep amazement the worth and dignity of every human being.&nbsp; In other words, TO SEE THE TRUTH OF CHRIST IS TO EXPERIENCE EVERY MAN, according to Antipope John Paul II, and this is the Good News of the Gospel.&nbsp;&nbsp; This means that every man is Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>Galatians 1:8-9- “But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach a gospel to you besides that which we have preached to you, let him be anathema.&nbsp; As we said before, so now I say again: If anyone preach to you a gospel, besides that which you have received, let him be anathema.”</p>

<h3><a id="Manisthe5" name="Manisthe5"></a><strong>5.&nbsp; Man is the Christ, the Son of the Living God</strong></h3>
<p>In the 16th Chapter of St. Matthew’s Gospel is recorded one of the most important events in the history of Christianity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“And Jesus came into the parts of Cesarea Philippi: and he asked his disciples, saying: Whom do men say that the Son of man is?&nbsp; But they said: Some John the Baptist, and others Elias, and others Jeremias, or one of the prophets.&nbsp; Jesus saith to them: But whom do you say that I am.&nbsp; Simon Peter answering said: <strong>Thou art Christ, the Son of the Living God</strong>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this dramatic moment in salvation history, St. Peter professed the truth that lies at the heart of the Gospel.&nbsp; He professed correctly that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the Living God.</p>
<p>In his very first homily, Antipope John Paul II addressed these words spoken by St. Peter about Our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Antipope John Paul II, Very First Homily, Forever Marking the Beginning of his Pastoral Ministry, Sunday, Oct. 22, 1978: “‘1. <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">You are the Christ, the Son of the living God</span>’</em></strong> (Mt. 16:16).&nbsp; These words were spoken by Simon, son of Jonah, in the district of Caesarea Philippi… These words mark the beginning of Peter’s mission in the history of salvation…</p>
<p>“2.&nbsp; On this day and in this place these same words must again be uttered and listened to: ‘<strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">You are the Christ, the Son of the living God</span></em></strong>.’&nbsp; Yes, Brothers and sons and daughters, these words first of all… please listen once again, today, in this sacred place, to the words uttered by Simon Peter.&nbsp; In those words is the faith of the Church.&nbsp; <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In those same words is the new truth, indeed, the ultimate and definitive truth about man: the Son of the living God – ‘You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.’”</span></em></strong><a id="_ednref24" title="" href="#_edn24" name="_ednref24">[24]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In his first ever homily as antipope in 1978, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in the very speech which will forever mark the beginning of his pastoral ministry</span>, Sunday, Oct. 22, 1978, Antipope John Paul II proclaimed to the world that MAN is the Christ, the Son of the Living God!&nbsp; He even said that this is a “new truth” – a new truth which he is here to reveal.&nbsp; “<em>Thou art the Christ, the Son of the Living God</em>,” spoken by St. Peter about Our Lord Jesus Christ are the words which describe the truth about man, according to Antipope John Paul II.</p>
<p>And it is no accident that Antipope John Paul II made this proclamation in his very first homily as antipope.&nbsp; He was here to preach man in the place of Christ, so he was setting forth his Antichrist doctrine from the very beginning.&nbsp; People cannot underestimate the significance of this speech.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Pope St. Pius X, <em>E Supremi Apostolatus</em>, Oct. 4, 1903: “While, on the other hand, and this according to the same apostle is <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the distinguishing mark of Antichrist, man has with infinite temerity put himself in the place of God</span></strong>.”<a id="_ednref25" title="" href="#_edn25" name="_ednref25">[25]</a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The distinguishing mark of Antichrist, man in the place of God, was the distinguishing mark of Antipope John Paul II.&nbsp; He was here to substitute the Gospel of Jesus Christ with a gospel of man as Christ; he was here to substitute the truth about Jesus Christ with the truth about man.</p>

<p>In Antipope John Paul II’s writings, one will find countless references to man.&nbsp; But in his writings one will also find countless references to “the truth about man” and “the whole truth about man.”&nbsp; We now know what Antipope John Paul II meant when he referred to this “truth about man.”&nbsp; It was that the truth about man is that he is Jesus Christ.</p>

<h3><a id="Wordbecameflesh7" name="Wordbecameflesh7"></a><strong>7.&nbsp; And the Word became flesh in every man</strong></h3>
<p>In John 1:14, we read about the Incarnation of the Son of God, “<em>And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us</em>.”&nbsp; Here is what Antipope John Paul II had to say about these words.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Antipope John Paul II, <em>Encyclical on the Holy Ghost </em>(# 50): “’<strong>The Word became flesh.’&nbsp; The Incarnation of God the Son signifies the taking up into unity with God not only of human nature, but in this human nature, in a sense, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">everything that is ‘flesh’: the whole of humanity</span></strong> ...”<a id="_ednref28" title="" href="#_edn28" name="_ednref28">[28]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here Antipope John Paul II quotes the words of John 1:14, and says that the Word becoming flesh means the taking up of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all flesh</span>, the whole of humanity.&nbsp; This literally means that the Son of God became all flesh, the whole of humanity.&nbsp; And this is why Antipope John Paul II says the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Antipope John Paul II, <em>Evangelium</em><em> Vitae</em> (# 104): <strong>“<span style="text-decoration: underline;">It is precisely in the ‘flesh’ of every person that Christ continues to reveal himself</span></strong> … so that <em>rejection of human life</em>, in whatever form that rejection takes, is <em>really a rejection of Christ.</em>”<a id="_ednref29" title="" href="#_edn29" name="_ednref29">[29]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here Antipope John Paul II confirms his doctrine as he set it forth in the <em>Encyclical on the Holy Ghost</em> #50.&nbsp; Because the Word became flesh <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in all of humanity</span>, it is in the flesh of EVERY PERSON that Christ reveals Himself.&nbsp; Every person is the Word made flesh, according to Antipope John Paul II.&nbsp; Notice how he even puts the word “flesh” in quotation marks, indicating specifically that every person is “the Word made flesh” of John 1:14.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This means that man is the Incarnate Word.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Antipope John Paul II, <em>Angelus Address</em>, Jan. 4, 1981: “<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The coming of God to the world, the birth of God in a human body</span>, is a penetrating and dazzling truth.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">It is a way along which man, as he walks, rediscovers himself</span></strong>.”<a id="_ednref31" title="" href="#_edn31" name="_ednref31">[31]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means that each man discovers that he is God in a human body.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Antipope John Paul II uttered this statement hundreds of times.&nbsp; He told us that it is only in the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">MYSTERY</span> of the Word made flesh – that is to say, only in the mystery of the God-man – that the mystery of each man becomes clear, because each man is the God-man, according to the doctrine of Antichrist which he preached.&nbsp; Notice that Antipope John Paul II <span style="text-decoration: underline;">did not say</span> that it is in the <em>teaching </em>of the Word made flesh that the mystery of man is made clear, but rather in the <em>mystery</em> of the Incarnate Word – the mystery of the God-man Himself – Our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Antipope John Paul II, <em>Veritatis</em><em> Splendor</em> (# 2), August 6, 1993: <strong>“In fact, <em>it is only in the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">mystery</span> of the Word Incarnate that light is shed on the mystery of man.</em></strong>”<a id="_ednref34" title="" href="#_edn34" name="_ednref34">[34]</a></p>

</blockquote>
<p>In Luke 1:45, we read that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Elizabeth praised Mary for her faith in the Lord</span>.&nbsp; Here is what Antipope John Paul II said about this event.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Antipope John Paul II, <em>Homily</em>, May 31, 1980: “On the threshold of the house of Zachariah, Elizabeth said to Mary: ‘<strong>Blessed are you, you who believed’ </strong>(Luke. 1:45).&nbsp; Let us do honor to maternity, because <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">faith in man is expressed in it</span></strong>… <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">IT IS NECESSARY TO BELIEVE IN MAN, from the beginning.&nbsp; BLESSED ARE YOU, MARY, YOU WHO BELIEVED</span>.”</strong><a id="_ednref37" title="" href="#_edn37" name="_ednref37"><strong><strong>[37]</strong></strong></a></p>

<p>Luke 1:45 tells us that Mary believed the Lord.&nbsp; In a homily commenting on Luke 1:45 Antipope John Paul II tells us that Mary <span style="text-decoration: underline;">believed in man from the beginning</span>.&nbsp; He was clearly saying that the Lord in whom Mary believed is each man.</p>

<h3><a id="ChristChild11" name="ChristChild11"></a><strong>11.&nbsp; Every man is the Christ Child born on Christmas</strong></h3>
<p>Just as Antipope John Paul II declared that man is the Christ, the Son of the Living God, in his very first homily, and just as he declared that Christianity, the Good News and the Gospel are the deep amazement at each man in his first encyclical, so too did this Antichrist have a message for the world in his very first Christmas address as antipope.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Antipope John Paul II, <em>Urbi</em><em> et Orbi, </em>Dec. 25, 1978: “I am addressing this message to every human being, to man in his humanity.&nbsp; <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Christmas is the feast of man</span>.”</strong><a id="_ednref38" title="" href="#_edn38" name="_ednref38"><strong><strong>[38]</strong></strong></a></span></p>

<p>The definition of Christmas is the following: “<strong>Christmas</strong> – <em>Christ’s Mass, the common English name for <strong>the feast of the birthday of our Lord</strong></em>…”<a id="_ednref39" title="" href="#_edn39" name="_ednref39">[39]</a>&nbsp; Christmas is the feast of Jesus Christ’s birth.&nbsp; So, why do we find Antipope John Paul II, in his first Christmas address, proclaiming to every human being that Christmas is “the feast of <strong>man</strong>”?&nbsp; It is precisely because he was totally Antichrist, who was here to preach man in the place of Christ.&nbsp; And this Antichrist continued to preach his message on Christmas for many years to come.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Antipope John Paul II, <em>Urbi</em><em> et Orbi, </em>Dec. 25, 1979: <strong>“Christmas is the feast of <em>all the children of the world</em></strong> – <strong>all of them…</strong>”<a id="_ednref40" title="" href="#_edn40" name="_ednref40">[40]</a></p>

</blockquote>
<p>No truth concerning man was uttered on Christmas night.&nbsp; The only truth that was uttered concerned the birth of the Savior: “<em>For, this day, is born to you a Savior, who is Christ the Lord, in the city of David</em>” (Luke 2:11).&nbsp; If Christmas night also brought forth the “full truth concerning man,” as Antipope John Paul II said, then the full truth concerning man is that he is Jesus Christ.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Antipope John Paul II, <em>Evangelium</em><em> Vitae</em> (# 1): “’… for to you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord’ (Lk. 2:10-11).&nbsp; <strong>The source of this ‘great joy’ is the birth of the Savior; but <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Christmas also reveals the full meaning of every human birth</span></strong>…”<a id="_ednref43" title="" href="#_edn43" name="_ednref43">[43]</a></p>

<p>Here Antipope John Paul II admits that <strong>the solemn celebration of Christmas is simply to bear witness to every human being</strong>.</p>

<p>In this incredible homily on Christmas, 1985, Antipope John Paul II declared that the Lord’s birth is the meaning of man, bluntly telling us that man is the Lord who is born on Christmas.</p>

<h3><a id="Epiphany12" name="Epiphany12"></a><strong>12.&nbsp; The Epiphany is the Manifestation of Man</strong></h3>
<p>The word “Epiphany” means a manifestation of God.&nbsp; Even Antipope John Paul II acknowledged this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Antipope John Paul II, <em>Angelus Address</em>, Jan. 2, 1983: “<strong>As is well known, Epiphany means the manifestation of Jesus to the people</strong>, the revelation of the Messiah awaited for centuries…”<a id="_ednref46" title="" href="#_edn46" name="_ednref46">[46]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But watch how this Antichrist also defined that every baby is an epiphany of God.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Antipope John Paul II, <em>Angelus Address</em>, Jan. 11, 1998: “<strong>Every baby who comes into the world is an ‘epiphany’ of God</strong>…”<a id="_ednref47" title="" href="#_edn47" name="_ednref47">[47]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This indicates, by his own definition – and consistent with all of his other preaching – that every baby who comes into the world is God.</p>
<p>In Apocalypse 3:14, Our Lord Jesus Christ calls Himself the “Amen,” the faithful and true witness.&nbsp; Antipope John Paul II says that each man is the <em>Amen</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Antipope John Paul II, <em>Familiaris</em><em> Consortio</em> (# 30), Nov. 22, 1981: “… the Church stands for life: <strong>IN EACH HUMAN LIFE she sees the splendor of that ‘Yes,’ that ‘Amen,’ who is Christ Himself</strong>.”<a id="_ednref48" title="" href="#_edn48" name="_ednref48">[48]</a></p>

<p>And there is no doubt that Antipope John Paul II was fully aware that he was putting man in the place of God when he preached that man is the way.&nbsp; He was fully aware of the fact that Jesus Christ alone is the Way.&nbsp; Yes, this man who spoke 14 languages fluently, who was the most seen person in the world, who traveled more miles than anyone in history, and spoke to more people than anyone in history, was fully aware that Jesus Christ is the Way.</p>

<p>Antipope John Paul II knew very well that Jesus alone is the Way, and yet he also preached over and over again that man is the Way.&nbsp; Antipope John Paul II was preaching to us that there is no contradiction between the two statements – that man and Christ are interchangeable because they are the same.</p>

<p>But Antipope John Paul II told us to make straight the way of the Lord AND OF MAN.&nbsp; His meaning is blatantly obvious!&nbsp; His meaning is that man is the Lord.&nbsp; In fact, notice the final phrase in this incredible quotation from Antipope John Paul II.&nbsp; He does not tell us to make straight the WAYS of the Lord and of man, which ARE the path of the Church.&nbsp; Rather he says, “<em>make straight <span style="text-decoration: underline;">THE WAY</span> of the Lord and of man, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">WHICH IS</span> the path of the Church</em>.”&nbsp; They are a single way, according to Antipope John Paul II.</p>

<p>Here this Antichrist tells us that Pilate’s question “<em>what is truth</em>” reflects the perplexity of a man who no longer knows <em>WHO HE IS!</em>&nbsp; Antipope John Paul II was here attempting to put his satanic gospel of Hell right in our faces.&nbsp; He was trying to put it right in our faces that man is the truth – that each man is really the Christ that Pilate couldn’t recognize – and that Pilate himself (when he failed to perceive the truth that was in his very presence, the truth that is Our Lord Jesus Christ) <em>failed to perceive who man is</em>!</p>
<p>Besides “the Truth,” one of Our Lord Jesus Christ’s primary titles is “the Word.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>John 1:1- “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.”</p>
<p>Antipope John Paul II acknowledged this fact in his<em> Encyclical on the Holy Ghost</em> # 36.</p>
<p>Antipope John Paul II<em>, Encyclical on the Holy Ghost</em> (# 36), May 18, 1986: “…<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the Word, the eternal Son</span>.”</strong><a id="_ednref64" title="" href="#_edn64" name="_ednref64"><strong><strong>[64]</strong></strong></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But watch how Antipope John Paul II applied this title of Our Lord to man in <em>the very next paragraph of this encyclical.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Antipope John Paul II, <em>Encyclical on the Holy Ghost </em>(# 37): “Here we find ourselves at the very center of what could be called <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the ‘anti-Word,’ that is to say the ‘anti-truth.’&nbsp; For the truth about man becomes falsified</span></strong>: who man is...”<a id="_ednref65" title="" href="#_edn65" name="_ednref65">[65]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the <em>Encyclical on the Holy Ghost</em> #36, Antipope John Paul II told us that Jesus Christ is the Word, the Eternal Son.&nbsp; Here, in #37 of the same encyclical, <strong>Antipope John Paul II tells us that the “anti-Word” and the “anti-truth” are a falsification of the truth about man</strong> – a falsification about <em>who man</em> is.&nbsp; This clearly means that man is the Word, the Truth, the Son of God.</p>

<h3><a id="ManisLife15" name="ManisLife15"></a><strong>15.&nbsp; Man is the Life</strong></h3>
<p>In John 14:6, Our Lord Jesus Christ identifies Himself not only as the Way and the Truth, but also as the Life.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“<em>I am the Way, and the Truth, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">and the Life</span></strong>…</em>”&nbsp; (Jn. 14:6)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jesus Christ tells us that He is the Life.&nbsp; St. John the Evangelist confirms this truth by describing Our Lord Jesus Christ as “the word of life” and the “life eternal” in his first epistle.</p>
<p>1st John Chapter 1 - “That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">of the word of life</span></strong>.&nbsp; For <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the life</span></strong> was manifested; and we have seen and do bear witness, and declare unto you <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the life eternal</span></strong>, which was with the Father, and hath appeared to us.”</p>
<p>In this profound passage of Sacred Scripture, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">St. John identifies that Jesus Christ is the Life Eternal</span>, as Our Lord Himself told us.&nbsp; But what does Antichrist say?&nbsp; In fact, what does Antichrist say about <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the very passage of Sacred Scripture that we just quoted</span> (the first chapter of St. John’s first epistle)?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Antipope John Paul II, <em>Evangelium</em><em> Vitae</em> (# 30), March 25, 1995: <strong>“The deepest and most original meaning of this meditation on what revelation tells us <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ABOUT HUMAN LIFE</span> was taken up by the Apostle John in the opening words of his First Letter</strong>: ‘That which was from the beginning, which we have heard… <strong>concerning the Word of life</strong> – the life was made manifest, and we saw it, and testify to it, and proclaim to you <strong>the eternal life which was with the Father and was made manifest to us</strong> …”<a id="_ednref66" title="" href="#_edn66" name="_ednref66">[66]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here Antipope John Paul II is quoting word for word the opening passage of St. John’s first epistle, where St. John describes hearing and seeing Jesus Christ: the Word of Life.&nbsp; He tells us that this passage about Our Lord Jesus Christ is actually what revelation tells us about <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">HUMAN LIFE</span>!&nbsp; </strong>It is not possible for Antipope John Paul II to have preached that man is Jesus Christ any more clearly!</p>
<p>And Antipope John Paul II knew exactly what he was saying when he attributed this verse about Our Lord to man, because just 50 paragraphs later in the same encyclical, <em>Evangelium</em><em> Vitae</em>, Antipope John Paul II again quoted the same verse of Scripture – but this time with the correct meaning!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Antipope John Paul II, <em>Evangelium</em><em> Vitae</em> (# 80.1): “<em>’That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes … concerning the Word of life</em>…’ <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Jesus is the only Gospel</span></em></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">: <strong>we have nothing further to say or any other witness to bear</strong></span><strong>.”</strong><a id="_ednref67" title="" href="#_edn67" name="_ednref67"><strong><strong>[67]</strong></strong></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, in one encyclical, Antipope John Paul II quoted the opening words of St. John’s first epistle two different times; and one time he says that it tells us about human life and one time he says it tells us about Jesus Christ.&nbsp; But, as we have shown, in the preaching of Antichrist this is no contradiction.&nbsp; In his preaching to speak of the “Life eternal” <strong>is</strong> to speak of man, and to speak of man <strong>is</strong> to speak of the “Life eternal.”</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Our Lord Jesus Christ, Body, Blood, Soul and Divinity is contained in the Eucharist.&nbsp; Antipope John Paul II says that what is contained in the Eucharist the life of every man has most deeply.&nbsp; This clearly means that each man has the Body, Blood, Soul and Divinity of Christ because each man is Christ.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Man does not discover his own sufferings in Christ’s sufferings because man is not Christ.&nbsp; But this is what Antichrist John Paul II was preaching.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Antipope John Paul II, <em>Speech in the Colosseum</em>, April 10, 1998: “<strong>As we contemplate Christ dead on the Cross, </strong><em>our thoughts turn to the countless injustices and sufferings which prolong his passion in every part of the world</em><strong>.&nbsp; I think of the places where man is insulted…”</strong><a id="_ednref73" title="" href="#_edn73" name="_ednref73"><strong><strong>[73]</strong></strong></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we contemplate Christ dead on the Cross, we don’t think of the places where man is insulted, because man is not the Crucified Christ.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Antipope John Paul II, <em>General Audience</em>, Jan. 12, 1994: "<strong>Even though St. Paul reminds us that 'Christ being raised from the dead will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him' (Rom. 6:9), death still continues to be a part of human existence</strong>. We are witnesses to a process of death in the Balkans, and, unfortunately, powerless witnesses at that.&nbsp; <strong><em>Christ continues to die</em></strong> amid the tragic events taking place in that part of the world, and that was the subject of our shared reflection.&nbsp; <strong>Christ continues his agony in so many of our brothers and sisters</strong>: in men, women and children, in the young and in the old, <strong>in so many Christians and Muslims, in believers and non-believers."</strong><a id="_ednref74" title="" href="#_edn74" name="_ednref74"><strong><strong>[74]</strong></strong></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Antipope John Paul II begins by admitting that Christ will never die again (Rom. 6:9).&nbsp; He then tells us that death continues to be a part of human existence.&nbsp; He then tells us that Christ continues to die, in Christians and Muslims, in believers and non-believers.&nbsp; His train of thought is not difficult to follow: though Christ will never die again, man still dies – thus Christ dies because man is Christ.&nbsp; He even stresses that Christ continues to die in Muslims and non-believers, which further confirms that he preaches that man is Christ.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Antipope John Paul II, <em>Homily</em>, Oct. 1, 1999: “<strong>He, <em>Emmanuel</em>, God-with-us, was crucified in the concentration camps and the gulags; he knew affliction under bombardment in the trenches; </strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">he suffered wherever the inalienable dignity of man, of every human being, was humiliated, oppressed and violated</span>.”<a id="_ednref75" title="" href="#_edn75" name="_ednref75">[75]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The term <em>Emmanuel </em>(God with us) is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">very</span> specific.&nbsp; It applies to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">one</span> Person.&nbsp; Our Lord Jesus Christ is <em>Emmanuel</em> (Isaias 7:14; Mt. 1:23).&nbsp; And Our Lord Jesus Christ was crucified <strong><em>once </em></strong>for our sins.&nbsp; By describing each man as Emmanuel, Antipope John Paul II was specifically indicating that each man is God with us.</p>
<p>It’s quite obvious that Antipope John Paul II preached that every man is the crucified Christ, the Savior of the World.&nbsp; But there is one place in his encyclical <em>Evangelium</em><em> Vitae</em> that is particularly interesting on this topic, as it demonstrates the deception and subtlety that Antichrist uses in his diabolical preaching.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Antipope John Paul II, <em>Evangelium</em><em> Vitae</em> (# 50.2), speaking of the darkness on Good Friday: “<strong>But <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the glory of the Cross</span> is not overcome by this darkness</strong>; rather, <strong>it shines forth ever more</strong> radiantly and brightly, <strong>and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is revealed as the</span></strong> center, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">meaning</span></strong> and goal of all history and <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">of every human life</span>.”</strong><a id="_ednref76" title="" href="#_edn76" name="_ednref76"><strong><strong>[76]</strong></strong></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, Antipope John Paul II says that <strong>the glory of the Cross is revealed as the meaning of EVERY HUMAN LIFE.&nbsp; </strong>Keep this in mind as we read the next quote from <em>Evangelium</em><em> Vitae</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Antipope John Paul II, <em>Evangelium</em><em> Vitae</em> (# 50.3): “Jesus is nailed to the Cross… It is thus, at the moment of his greatest weakness, that <strong>the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Son of God is revealed for who he is<em>: on the cross his glory is made manifest</em></span>.”</strong><a id="_ednref77" title="" href="#_edn77" name="_ednref77"><strong><strong>[77]</strong></strong></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, Antipope John Paul II tells us that <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">by the glory of the Cross the Son of God is revealed for who He is</span></strong>.&nbsp; But he just told us, one paragraph before this, that the glory of the Cross is the meaning of EVERY HUMAN LIFE.&nbsp; This means, by way of logical equation, that the <strong>Son of God = the meaning of every human life</strong>.&nbsp; To illustrate this, we will look again at his words.</p>

<ul>
 	<li>The glory of the Cross is the meaning of every human life (Evangelium Vitae # 50.2).</li>
 	<li>The glory of the Cross reveals the Son of God (Evangelium Vitae # 50.3).</li>
 	<li>Conclusion: The Son of God is the meaning of every human life.</li>

<p>“<strong><em>And he (Jesus) said to them: You are from beneath, I am from above</em></strong><em>.&nbsp; You are of this world, I am not of this world.&nbsp; Therefore I said to you, that you shall die in your sins.&nbsp; For if you believe not that I am He, you shall die in your sin</em>.”</p>

<p>In this profound verse of St. John’s Gospel, Our Lord Jesus Christ describes <strong>Himself as <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the one from above</span></strong>.&nbsp; <strong>He describes man as the one from below</strong>.&nbsp; Keep this in mind as we read the following words from Antipope John Paul II.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Antipope John Paul II, <em>Homily</em>, March 30, 1982: “Looking at himself, man discovers also – as Christ says in the dialogue with the Pharisees – what is ‘from below’ and what is ‘from above.’&nbsp; <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Man discovers within himself (this is a constant experience) the man ‘from below’ and the man ‘from above</span>’ not two men, but almost two dimensions of the same man, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the man that is each one of us</span>: of you, he, she.”</strong><a id="_ednref87" title="" href="#_edn87" name="_ednref87"><strong><strong>[87]</strong></strong></a></p>

<p>Antichrist Antipope John Paul II tells us that within the Mother of God is the history of every human being.&nbsp; <strong>But within Mary there was only Jesus Christ</strong>, the Son of the living God.&nbsp; By saying that every human being everywhere on Earth was in the womb of the Mother of God, Antipope John Paul II was indicating that every human being everywhere on Earth is Jesus Christ.</p>

<h3><a id="NewEvangelization22" name="NewEvangelization22"></a><strong>22.&nbsp; The New Evangelization</strong></h3>
<p>Antichrist wants to evangelize the world to man, making everything more human, because all of humanity is Christ, according to his gospel.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Antipope John Paul II, <em>Homily</em>, May 15, 1982: <strong>“Education</strong>… <strong>is intended to ‘humanize’ man.”</strong><a id="_ednref102" title="" href="#_edn102" name="_ednref102"><strong><strong>[102]</strong></strong></a></p>
<p>Antipope John Paul II, <em>Homily</em>, July 7, 1980: <strong>“The true apostle of the Gospel is he who humanizes and evangelizes at the same time...”</strong><a id="_ednref103" title="" href="#_edn103" name="_ednref103"><strong><strong>[103]</strong></strong></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And in trying to convert the world to man as Christ, this Antichrist often explicitly equated becoming more human with becoming more divine; that is to say, he explicitly equated becoming more like man with becoming more like God.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Antipope John Paul II, <em>Address to the Slovenians</em>, May 18, 1996: “In this way you will help change the world; <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">you will make it more human and thus more divine</span>.”</strong><a id="_ednref104" title="" href="#_edn104" name="_ednref104"><strong><strong>[104]</strong></strong></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here Antipope John Paul II says that to be more like man is thus (therefore) to become more like God, indicating that man is God.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Antipope John Paul II, <em>Incarnationis</em><em> mysterium</em> (# 2): “…<strong>the Church opens to all people the prospect of being ‘divinized’ <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and thus of becoming more human</span>.”</strong><a id="_ednref105" title="" href="#_edn105" name="_ednref105"><strong><strong>[105]</strong></strong></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here again, Antipope John Paul II explicitly says that to become more divine is thus (therefore) to become more human, therefore equating God with man.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Antipope John Paul II, <em>Address to Portuguese Bishops</em>, Nov. 30, 1999: “<strong>In fact, <em>by his Incarnation, he, the Son of God, has in a certain way united himself with each man… </em></strong>the Christian way of life not only gives meaning to what exists, but also opens ‘to all people <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the prospect of being divinized and thus of becoming more human.</span>’</strong>”<a id="_ednref106" title="" href="#_edn106" name="_ednref106">[106]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here again Antipope John Paul II equates being divinized with becoming more human, and he bases it again on the Incarnation.</p>

<h3><a id="Manmustdiscover23" name="Manmustdiscover23"></a><strong>23.&nbsp; Man must discover that he is God</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Antipope John Paul II, <em>Homily</em>, March 6, 1988: “<strong>Yes, God is ‘jealous’ <em>for that divine element which exists in man</em></strong> …<strong><em>‘<span style="text-decoration: underline;">You shall not have other gods before me</span>.&nbsp; You shall love your God with all your heart, with all your mind, and with all your strength</em>.’</strong>&nbsp; <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Otherwise, you, man, shall not discover yourself</span>!”</strong><a id="_ednref107" title="" href="#_edn107" name="_ednref107"><strong><strong>[107]</strong></strong></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Antipope John Paul II quotes the first commandment about worshipping God and he says that <strong>if you don’t worship God you will not discover yourself</strong>!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Antipope John Paul II, <em>Angelus Address</em>, March 7, 1982: <strong>“What value, then, does Christ’s call to conversion and belief in the Gospel have?</strong>&nbsp; <strong>What meaning do reconciliation with God and penance have</strong> in the ongoing mission of the Church?&nbsp; However and also perhaps<strong> above all the call is addressed to man, to every man, that he may again find himself!&nbsp; That he may believe in himself.”</strong><a id="_ednref108" title="" href="#_edn108" name="_ednref108"><strong><strong>[108]</strong></strong></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an amazing <em>Angelus Address</em>, even for one thoroughly possessed by the spirit of Antichrist.&nbsp; In it, Antipope John Paul II asks: “What is the meaning of reconciliation with God,” and “What is the value of conversion and belief in the Gospel?”<strong>&nbsp; He answers his own questions by stating that above all it is for man to find himself and believe in himself!&nbsp; </strong>Therefore, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">conversion, belief in the Gospel, and reconciliation with God equal man finding himself and believing in himself</span>.&nbsp; Man is God, according to the doctrine of Antichrist.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Antipope John Paul II, <em>Ecclesia in America</em> (# 67): “… Jesus Christ, the human face of God and the divine face of man.”<a id="_ednref109" title="" href="#_edn109" name="_ednref109">[109]</a></p>

</blockquote>
<p>There you have it!&nbsp; Here Antipope John Paul II says that by revealing <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Himself</span> on Mt. Sinai, God revealed man to man himself!</p>

<p>Ephesians 3:8- “To me, the least of all the saints, is given this grace, to preach among the Gentiles, <strong>the unsearchable riches of Christ.</strong>”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Ephesians 3:8, St. Paul says that he was given the grace to preach the unsearchable riches of Christ to the Gentiles.&nbsp; St. Paul was referring to the attributes of Our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God.&nbsp; Christ’s attributes as the Son of God are unsearchable and unfathomable.&nbsp; But Antipope John Paul II told us that these unsearchable riches of Christ are actually the property of each man.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Antipope John Paul II, <em>Redemptor</em><em> Hominis</em> (# 11), March 4, 1979: “… in short, helping everyone to get to know ‘the unsearchable riches of Christ,’ since these riches are for every individual <span style="text-decoration: underline;">AND ARE EVERYBODY’S PROPERTY</span>.”<a id="_ednref113" title="" href="#_edn113" name="_ednref113">[113]</a></p>

</blockquote>
<p>Antipope John Paul II could hardly have been more blunt.&nbsp; He says that to contemplate the truth about man is to turn inevitably to the risen Christ.&nbsp; The truth about man, therefore, is that man is the risen Christ.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Antipope John Paul II, <em>Regina Caeli</em>, April 28, 2002, On the Risen Christ: “<strong>His radiant countenance of glory fully reveals to us the truth of God <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and the truth of man</span></strong>.”<a id="_ednref115" title="" href="#_edn115" name="_ednref115">[115]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This again proves the point we’ve been making throughout this section on Antipope John Paul II’s preaching.&nbsp; It proves that Antipope John Paul II was totally possessed by the spirit of Antichrist, that he preached the exact doctrine of Antichrist, and that one of his main goals was to replace the truth about Christ (the most important truth in the universe) with the truth about man.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Antipope John Paul II,<em> Address to Missionaries of Precious Blood</em>, September 14, 2001: “And at the moment of Easter this joy came to its fullness as the light of divine glory shone on the face of <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the Risen Lord, whose wounds shine forever like the Sun</span>. </strong>&nbsp;<strong>This is the truth of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">who you are</span>, dear Brothers</strong>…”<a id="_ednref116" title="" href="#_edn116" name="_ednref116">[116]</a></p>

<h2><a id="FinalAntichristRevealed27" name="FinalAntichristRevealed27"></a><strong>27.&nbsp; Antichrist Revealed</strong></h2>
<p>Read God’s infallible definition of Antichrist in Sacred Scripture:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1 John 4:2-3 – “Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is of God: <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">And every spirit that dissolveth Jesus is not of God: and this is Antichrist</span></strong>, of whom you have heard that he cometh, <strong>and he is now already in the world</strong>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice that Antichrist is a spirit that was in the world <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in St. John’s time</span>.&nbsp; That means that Antichrist has been around since the time of Christ.&nbsp; Antichrist is a spirit that occupies different people since the time of Christ and until His Second Coming; <strong>but there will be a unique manifestation and personification of that spirit at the end of the world – at the time of or just before the Second Coming – which will be a major sign of the end.</strong>&nbsp; And what does God’s word say about this spirit and personification of Antichrist?&nbsp; It is a spirit that <em>dissolves</em> Jesus, and <em>denieth</em><em> that Jesus is the Christ</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1 John 2:22 – “Who is a liar, but<strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">he who denieth that Jesus is the Christ?&nbsp; He is antichrist</span></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">,</span> who denieth the Father, and the Son.”</p>

<p>We have proven that Antipope John Paul II’s distinguishing teaching is this very thing; his distinguishing teaching is that the Son of God was dissolved into every man in the Incarnation, making every man Christ, thus dissolving Jesus and denying that Jesus is the Christ.&nbsp; At the very least, one can say that Antipope John Paul II was totally possessed with the spirit of Antichrist and that he preached exactly the doctrine of Antichrist.&nbsp; John Paul II exemplified and personified the spirit of Antichrist; it came out of him with astounding diabolical precision.</p>
<p>What’s also fascinating is how Antipope John Paul II’s own Catechism defines the Antichrist.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Antipope John Paul II, <em>New Catechism of the Catholic Church</em>, # 675: “<strong>The supreme religious deception is that of the Antichrist, a pseudo-messianism <span style="text-decoration: underline;">by which man glorifies himself in place of God and of his Messiah come in the flesh</span></strong>.”<a id="_ednref117" title="" href="#_edn117" name="_ednref117">[117]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Antipope John Paul II’s own Catechism could not have described his doctrine better!</strong>&nbsp; It accurately pinpoints that the deception of Antichrist is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a false or pseudo-messianism in which MAN replaces the Son of God come in the flesh</span>!&nbsp; This religion of Antichrist is not only preached by Antipope John Paul II as his distinguishing mark, but it is actually practiced in the liturgy of his Vatican II church.</p>
<p>By attempting to put Christ to death in the Mass and by replacing it with a non-Catholic counterfeit service, Paul VI definitely represented the fulfillment of Antichrist in the Vatican, as prophesied by Our Lady of La Salette.</p>

<p>The <a title="The Invalid New Mass" href="https://vaticancatholic.com/new-mass-traditional-latin-mass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New Mass</a> of the Vatican II counterfeit church <span style="text-decoration: underline;">puts man in the place of God</span> – the doctrine of Antichrist – by having the priest face man instead of God during the liturgy, and by orienting the entire worship toward man instead of toward God.</p>
<p>The New Mass, the liturgy of Antipope John Paul II’s counterfeit Catholic Church, is attempting to indoctrinate the masses into idolatry and the worship of man, just as Antipope John Paul II preached it to the people in his encyclicals and speeches.</p>
<p>While Benedict XVI doesn’t yet teach the dissolving of Jesus to the same extent as John Paul II, it’s quite interesting that he covers Sacred Scripture’s other definition for Antichrist – the denial of Jesus as the Christ!&nbsp; <a title="The Heresies of Benedict XVI" href="https://vaticancatholic.com/anti-pope-benedict-xvi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Benedict XVI</a> represents Antichrist in the Vatican by putting the denial of Jesus Christ on a par with the acceptance of Him, as we’ve shown.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>John Paul II preached the dissolving of Jesus (one definition of Scripture for Antichrist), while <strong>Benedict XVI preaches that He might not be the Christ (the second definition for Antichrist)!</strong>&nbsp; Thus, Our Lady’s prophecy has been fulfilled.&nbsp; <a title="Vatican II “Catholic” Church Exposed" href="https://vaticancatholic.com/vatican-ii-exposed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Vatican II sect is the Counter Church</a> of the Antichrist; it has been installed by a series of antichrists who are preaching a new Gospel of respect for false religions, religious indifferentism, acceptance of the false gods of the East, acceptance of the heresies of Protestantism, Eastern ‘Orthodoxy’, etc.&nbsp; This has resulted in a spiritual wasteland and a myriad of bad fruits.</p>
<p>Catholics should take heart in these prophetic warnings that Heaven has given us, which have clearly foreseen our days.&nbsp; We should have confidence knowing that God is still with His Church, as He will be until the consummation of the world (Mt. 28)&nbsp; He will never allow it to be completely destroyed or fall into any error.&nbsp; There will always remain a remnant of Catholics who hold to the full deposit of the faith and do not compromise with heresy, even though God has allowed Satan, as a punishment for the sins of men in these last days, the power to invade and take over the countless schools, seminaries, colleges, universities, chapels and buildings that once belonged to the true Catholic Church.</p>
<p>God has allowed Satan to take these structures to himself and implant in them a non-Catholic apostate religion which is not Catholic but retains the name.&nbsp; We must oppose and have no part with this counterfeit Catholic Church, which has been created by Satan.&nbsp; We must have no part with its false Mass, false sacraments, heretical antipopes and heretical “bishops.”&nbsp; We must inform ourselves and others of the correct positions to take in this regard, which have been set out in this book based on the teaching of the Catholic Church.&nbsp; We must try to bring people back to the true Catholic Church which was founded by Jesus Christ, which can never be destroyed, which has been reduced to a remnant in this time of the Great Apostasy, and to which all must belong in order to be saved.</p>
