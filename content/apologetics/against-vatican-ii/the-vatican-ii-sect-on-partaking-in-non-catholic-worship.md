<p style="text-align: center;">John Paul II in common prayer in 1982, in the Anglican Cathedral, with the schismatic and heretical “Archbishop” of Canterbury (an Anglican), who is just a layman posing as a bishop</p>
<p>We’ve already documented that the Vatican II antipopes repeatedly partake in non-Catholic religious ceremonies.&nbsp; This was condemned by Pope Pius XI.&nbsp; Expressing the universal Tradition of the Church on this matter, he stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Pius XI, <em>Mortalium Animos</em> (# 10), Jan. 6, 1928: “… <strong>this Apostolic See has never allowed its subjects to take part in the assemblies of non-Catholics</strong>…”<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>All Catholic moral theology manuals before Vatican II reiterated this truth.&nbsp; They taught that it’s a mortal sin against the divine law for Catholics to partake in non-Catholic worship.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Pius IX, <em>Neminem vestrum</em> (# 5), Feb. 2, 1854: “We want you to know that those same monks sent Us a splendid profession of Catholic faith and doctrine… <strong>They eloquently acknowledged and freely received <u>the regulations and decrees which the popes and the sacred congregations published</u> or would publish – <u>especially those which prohibit <em>communicatio in divinis</em> (communion in holy matters) with schismatics</u></strong>… They acknowledge that they condemn the error of the schismatic Armenians and recognize that they are outside of the Church of Jesus Christ.”<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[3]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice that the decrees and regulations of the popes prohibit communication in divine things with schismatics.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Pius VI, <em>Charitas </em>(# 31-32), April 13, 1791, speaking of priests who went along with the notoriously heretical civil constitution of the clergy in France: “Above all, avoid and condemn the sacrilegious intruders… <strong>do not hold communion with them especially in divine worship</strong>.”<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4">[4]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Speaking of priests who belong to the “Old Catholic” sect, which publicly rejects Vatican I and its definition on Papal Infallibility, Pope Pius IX declared:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Pius IX, <em>Graves</em><em> ac diuturnae</em> (# 4), March 23, 1875: “<strong><u>They [the faithful] should totally shun their religious celebrations, their buildings,</u></strong> and their chairs of pestilence which they have with impunity established to transmit the sacred teachings.&nbsp; They should shun their writings and all contact with them.&nbsp; They should not have any dealings or meetings with usurping priests and apostates from the faith who dare to exercise the duties of an ecclesiastical minister without possessing a legitimate mission or any jurisdiction.”<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5">[5]</a></p>
<p>Canon 1258.1, 1917 Code of Canon Law: “It is not licit for the faithful by any manner to assist actively or to have a part in the sacred rites of non-Catholics.”<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6">[6]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the Vatican II sect and its “popes” officially teach just the opposite:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Vatican II document,<em> Unitatis redintegratio</em> (# 15):<br>“These churches [the schismatic “Orthodox”], though separated from us, yet possess true sacraments… Therefore <strong><u>some worship in common</u></strong>, given suitable circumstances and the approval of church authority, <strong><u>is not merely possible but to be encouraged</u></strong>.”<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7">[7]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an attempt to overturn the divine law forbidding Catholics to partake in non-Catholic worship.&nbsp; It is heresy.&nbsp; This is why we have repeatedly seen the post-Vatican II antipopes partake in non-Catholic worship and pray with non-Catholics.</p>
<p><br><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-125019 aligncenter" src="https://vaticancatholic.com/images/b-16-ecumenical-vesper.jpg" alt="" width="70%"></p>
<p>Benedict XVI praying ecumenical Vespers on Sept. 12, 2006.<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8">[8]</a>&nbsp; Notice that Benedict XVI explicitly acknowledges that he is worshipping with them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>Address during ecumenical Vespers service</em>, Sept. 12, 2006: “Dear Brothers and Sisters in Christ! &nbsp;We are gathered, <u>Orthodox Christians, Catholics and Protestants – and together with us there are also some Jewish friends</u> – to sing together the evening praise of God… This is an hour of gratitude for the fact that <strong><u>we can pray together in this way</u></strong>…”<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9">[9]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this book, we have given and will continue to give many other examples of this activity from the Vatican II antipopes.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>The incredible Directory for the Application of the Principles and Norms of Ecumenism </strong></p>
<p>Perhaps the clearest expression of the new religion in regard to participation in non-Catholic worship is the <em>Directory for the Application of the Principles and Norms of Ecumenism</em>, promulgated by John Paul II and the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity in 1993.</p>
<p>In # 23, it encourages Episcopal Conferences to take "special measures" to <u>avoid the "danger of proselytism"</u> (trying to convert others).<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10">[10]</a></p>
<p>In # 50c, it encourages Catholic religious to organize meetings among Protestants of “<u>various churches</u>… <u>for liturgical prayer</u>, for recollection, and spiritual exercises.”<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11">[11]</a></p>
<p>In # 85, the Directory explains how "it is useful" to encourage <u>exchanges between Catholic monasteries and those of other religions</u>.<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12">[12]</a></p>
<p>In # 118, the Directory says that <u>Catholics who attend non-Catholic churches are "<strong>encouraged to take part in the psalms, responses, hymns and common actions of the Church in which they are guests</strong></u>.”<a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13">[13]</a></p>
<p>As we can see, <strong>#50c and #118 specifically encourage exactly what Pius XI said the Apostolic See has never allowed: participation in non-Catholic worship</strong>.</p>
<p>In # 119, it states: "<u>In a Catholic liturgical celebration, ministers of other Churches or ecclesial Communities may have the place and liturgical honors proper to their rank and their role</u>..."<a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14">[14]</a></p>
<p>In # 137, it states, "<u>if priests, ministers or communities not in full communion with the Catholic Church do not have a place or the liturgical objects necessary for celebrating worthily their religious ceremonies, the diocesan bishop may allow them the use of a church or a Catholic buildin</u>g and also lend them what may be necessary for their services.&nbsp; Under similar circumstances, permission may be given to them for interment or for the celebration of services at Catholic cemeteries."<a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15">[15]</a></p>
<p>In # 158, the Directory says that when mixed marriages take place "the local Ordinary may permit the Catholic priest <strong>to invite the minister of the party of the other Church or ecclesial Community to participate in the celebration of the marriage, to read from the Scriptures, give a brief exhortation, and bless the couple."<a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16">[16]</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>In # 187, the Directory recommends that Catholics and non-Catholics work together in drawing up texts of common Creeds, psalms, scriptural readings, and hymnbooks to be used when they pray and witness together.<a href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17">[17]</a></p>
<p>This is a new religion.&nbsp; It is an official program of participation in non-Catholic worship, directly contrary to the divine law which teaches that Catholics are forbidden to partake in non-Catholic worship.</p>
<p>On March 25, 1993, Antipope John Paul II "approved this Directory, confirmed it by his authority and ordered that it be published. &nbsp;Anything to the contrary notwithstanding."<a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18">[18]</a>&nbsp; John Paul II also approved this incredibly heretical directory on ecumenism in his encyclical <em>Ut Unum Sint</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>John Paul II, <em>Ut Unum Sint</em> (# 16), May 25, 1995: “More recently, <strong>the <em>Directory for the Application of Principles and Norms of Ecumenism</em></strong>, <strong>issued with my approval</strong> by the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity, has applied them to the pastoral sphere.”<a href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19">[19]</a></p>

<p>So, the question is: How can the Catholic Church now teach and recommend (participation in non-Catholic worship) exactly what the Catholic Church has always forbidden under pain of mortal sin?&nbsp; The answer is that it cannot overturn something that involves the Faith and is connected to the divine law.&nbsp; The answer is that such a new teaching is absolute proof that the Vatican II sect and its antipopes are formally heretical and hold no authority in the Catholic Church.</p>
