title: The Idolatry Of The Vatican II Sect & Its Rampant Homosexuality
type: article
---



<p>Scripture teaches that homosexuality is a result of idolatry. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>Romans 1- “Because that, when they knew God, they have not glorified him as God, or given thanks; but became vain in their thoughts, and their foolish heart was darkened... <strong><u>who changed the truth of God into a lie; and worshipped and served the creature rather than the Creator</u></strong>, who is blessed for ever.  Amen.  <strong><u>For this cause God delivered them up to shameful affections</u>.  For their women have changed the natural use into that use which is <u>against nature</u>.  And, in like manner, the men also, leaving the natural use of the women, have burned in their lusts one towards another, men with men working that which is filthy, and receiving in themselves the recompense which was due to their error</strong>... they who do such things, are worthy of death; and not only they that do them, but they also that consent to them that do them.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Vatican II Sect contradicts this teaching of Scripture by asserting that the cause of homosexuality is unknown, and that the homosexual orientation is not wrong.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>John Paul II, New Catechism, #2357: “Homosexuality… <u>Its psychological genesis remains largely unexplained</u>.”<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Romans 1 clearly teaches that homosexuality is “<em>against nature</em>,” which means that <strong><u>this orientation is foreign to man’s nature</u></strong>; that is, it is NOT INSTILLED BY GOD.  As a result of idolatry, God sometimes allows a demon to take people over, possess them, and change their sexual orientation, as St. Paul describes.</p>
<p>Men and women are given over to homosexuality for inundating themselves with sins of impurity – thereby worshipping the flesh rather than God.  For this sin they can get possessed by the demon of lust, which takes them over and corrupts their entire orientation.  (And they can be cured of this.)  People also become homosexuals by engaging in idolatry by either harboring a perverse fascination with human beings over God – thereby worshipping the creature rather than the Creator – or by simply worshipping something that is a creature or the works of one’s hands.  The fact that all homosexuals are possessed by a demon is corroborated by the fact that most homosexual males can be identified by their effeminate external mannerisms.  What explains this?  It’s obviously the demon’s presence in the person making itself manifest externally – <em>the external, unnatural mannerisms revealing the internal corruption of the soul</em>. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Isaias 3:9 – "<strong><em><u>The shew of their countenance doth witness against them; and they declare their sin as Sodom</u></em></strong>, they hide it not. Woe unto their soul!  For they have rewarded evil unto themselves."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice that the prophet Isaias, referring to homosexuals, says that “<em>they have <u>rewarded</u> evil unto themselves</em>.”  This is strikingly similar to Romans 1 above, where St. Paul says that homosexuals have <em>received “in themselves the <u>recompense</u> [reward] which was due to their error</em>.”</p>
<p>An examination of the most demonic cultures in history corroborates Scripture’s teaching on the connection between idolatry (whether of the flesh or of the work of one’s hands or of oneself) with homosexuality.  <strong>All of this is relevant because homosexuality is rampant among the Vatican II clergy.  </strong></p>
<p>The Aztec culture in Mexico in the 15<sup>th</sup> and 16<sup>th</sup> centuries, which the Catholic conquistadors physically overthrew – and which the appearance of Our Lady of Guadalupe (1531) spiritually crushed – was arguably the wickedest culture in human history.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Warren H. Carroll, <em>Our Lady of Guadalupe and the Conquest of Darkness</em>, pp. 8-11:<br />“<strong>Many primitive peoples have practiced occasional human sacrifice and some have practiced cannibalism.  None has ever done so on a scale remotely approaching that of the Aztecs</strong>.  No one will ever know how many they sacrificed; but the law of the empire required a thousand sacrifices to the Aztec tribal god Huitzilopochtli in every town with a temple, every year; and there were 371 subject towns in the Aztec empire…</p>
<p>“<strong>Every Aztec city and large town had a central square</strong>, <strong>from which a high pyramidal temple rose</strong>, and four gates opening upon four roads approaching the town in straight lines extending at least five miles, each ending at one side of the pyramid temple… <strong><u>Month after month, year after year, in temple after temple, the sacrificial victims came down the roads to the steps</u></strong>, climbed up the steps to the platform at the top, <strong>and there were bent backwards over large convex slabs of polished stone</strong> by a hook around the neck wielded by a priest with head and arms stained black, never-cut black hair all caked and matted with dried blood, and once-white garments soaked and stained with innumerable gouts of crimson<strong>.  <u>An immense knife with a blade of midnight black volcanic glass rose and fell, cutting the victim open.  His heart was torn out while still beating</u> and held up for all to see</strong>, <strong>while his ravaged body was kicked over the edge of the temple platform where it bounced and slithered in obscene contortions down the steps to the bottom a hundred feet below</strong>.  Later, the limbs of the body were eaten…</p>
<p>“The early Mexican historian Ixtlilxochitl estimated that one out of every five children in Mexico was sacrificed… <strong>An almost universal symbol in Mexican religion was the serpent.</strong>  Sacrifices were heralded by the prolonged beating of an immense drum made of skins of huge snakes, which could be heard two miles away.  <strong>Nowhere else in human history has Satan so formalized and institutionalized his worship with so many of his own actual titles and symbols</strong>.”<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is a description of the 1487 Aztec dedication of a new pyramid temple to their false god, Huitzilopochtli:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>Tlacaellell decided that this central temple should be dedicated with the greatest mass sacrifice of his fifty-eight years of dominance</strong> in the Aztec empire.  As always, he had his way.  In R.C. Padden’s memorable description: ‘<strong><u>Well before daybreak of the opening day, legionnaires prepared victims, who were put in close single file down the steps of the great pyramid</u></strong>, through the city, out over the causeways, and as far as the eye could see.  <strong>For the average person viewing the spectacle from roof top, it would appear that the victims stretched in lines to the end of the earth</strong>.  The bulk of unfortunates were from hostile provinces and the swollen ranks of slavery.  <strong><u>On the pyramid’s summit, four slabs had been set up, one at the head of each staircase</u></strong>, for Tlacaellel and the three kings of the Triple Alliance, all of whom were to begin the affair as sacrificial priests.  All were in readiness; the lines of victims were strung out for miles, with great reservoirs at their ends, <strong>thousands of trapped humans milling about like cattle, awaiting their turn in the line that was about to move</strong>.  Suddenly, the brilliantly arrayed kings approached Huitzilopochtli’s [the false god’s] chapel and made reverent obeisance.  As they turned to join their aides at the four slabs, <strong><u>great snakeskin drums began to throb, announcing that the lines could now begin to move</u></strong>.</p>
<p>“<strong>Relays of priests dispatched the victims</strong>.  <strong>As each group tired</strong> <strong>[of killing], others of the thousands who were to live below in the new temple stepped forward to relieve them and keep up the pace</strong>.  Years of practice had given them a skill and speed almost incredible.  Reliable evidence indicates that it took only fifteen seconds to kill each victim.  <strong><u>Blood and bodies cascaded in an endless stream down the temple steps.  Hearts were assembled in piles and skulls in endless racks</u></strong>.</p>
<p>“It went on four days and four nights.  More than eighty thousand men were killed.  Tlacaellel had commanded all the high nobility of Mexico to be present, watching from scented, rose-covered boxes; but eventually the bonds of custom and even of fear were burst by overwhelming horror, and most of the spectators fled, along with many people of the city.  Even those who could hide from the sight of what was happening were unable any longer to endure the stench.  <strong>But Tlacaellel [the leader of the Empire] at eighty-nine remained to the very end, watching the victims killed at fifteen seconds per man, <u>until the last of the eighty thousand had their hearts torn out before his devouring eyes</u></strong>.”<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[3]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps this bit of history, more than any other, illustrates the truth of the scriptural teaching that the gods of the heathen are actually devils.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Psalms 95:5- “For all the gods of the Gentiles are devils…”<span style="font-size: inherit;">              </span></p>
<p>1 Cor. 10:20- “But the things which the heathens sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God.  And I would not that you should be made partakers with devils.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It also demonstrates the connection of idolatry with homosexuality, for the Catholic conquistadors, “After repelling the attack [of the Aztecs], saw their first small temples. ‘<strong>There were clay idols made of pottery</strong>,’ Bernal Diaz tells us, ‘<strong>with the faces of demons or women and other evil figures <u>that showed Indians committing acts of sodomy with each other</u></strong>.’”<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4">[4]</a> </p>
<p>It was such a problem that Cortes told the Aztecs: “I would have you know that we have come from afar… <strong><u>Give up your sodomy</u></strong> and all your other evil practices, for so commands Our Lord God, Whom we believe and Whom we adore…”<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5">[5]</a> </p>
<p>St. Francis Xavier (16<sup>th</sup> century) witnessed the same thing when preaching the faith in pagan Japan.  “Fucarandono then went on with the general subject, and afterwards asked Francis Xavier why he forbade <strong><u>the unnatural lusts so common in Japan</u></strong>.”<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6">[6]</a>  These unnatural lusts were so common because they worshipped some 33,000 idols at the temple at Kioto.<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7">[7]</a>  As Romans 1 teaches, unnatural lusts are connected with idolatry. </p>
<p>That’s why unnatural lusts are so common among the clergy of the Vatican II sect: they are steeped in idolatry.</p>
