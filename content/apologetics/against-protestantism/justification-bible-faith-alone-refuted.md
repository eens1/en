<p>This is a must-see new documentary. Among many other things, it explains, examines, and refutes the historic Protestant teaching on Justification (and Forensic Justification) by exposing a fatal flaw at its core.  It reveals a devastating new argument and disproves the Protestant position by using the words of the Protestants themselves.  It shows that the key salvation doctrine of the Protestant ‘Reformation’ is fundamentally contradictory.  It thus serves to refute and expose the entire Protestant 'Reformation'.  Among many other things, this documentary discusses, refutes, and exposes the views of prominent Protestants, including John MacArthur, James White, John Piper, R.C. Sproul, Michael Kruger, Steven Anderson, Charles Stanley, and numerous others.  It also covers water baptism, faith alone, whether the justified can fall away, and much more.  It’s essential for everyone to see this video.  It’s especially relevant to anyone interested in the true teaching of the Gospel, the Bible’s teaching on salvation, apologetics, or Catholic vs. Protestant issues.  This video contains many extremely interesting and revealing video clips.</p>
