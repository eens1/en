<p>“The Madonna always stresses that there is but one God and that people have enforced unnatural separation.  <strong>One cannot truly believe, be a true Christian, if he does not respect other religions as well</strong>.”[1]  – “Seer" Ivanka Ivankovic</p>
<p>“The Madonna said that religions are separated in the earth, <strong>but the people of all religions are accepted by her Son</strong>.”[2]  – “Seer” Ivanka Ivankovic</p>
<p><strong>Question: “Is the Blessed Mother calling all people to be Catholic?”  Answer: “No. The</strong> <strong>Blessed Mother says <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ll religions are dear to her and her Son</span>.”</strong><strong>[3]  </strong>– “Seer” Vicka Ivankovic</p>

<p>This is total apostasy in the Message of Medjugorje.  It is a rejection of Catholic dogma.  It is a rejection of the dogma <a title="Outside The Church There Is No Salvation And Refuting Baptism Of Desire" href="https://vaticancatholic.com/outside-the-church-there-is-no-salvation/">Outside the Catholic Church There is No Salvation</a>.  It is a total rejection of the clear teaching of the Gospel on the necessity of believing in Jesus Christ, the Son of God, for salvation.  This proves that Medjugorje, like the rest of the false modern apparitions, is a deception of the Devil.  Those who are aware of these facts and refuse to reject it as a false apparition are rejecting the Catholic Faith.</p>
