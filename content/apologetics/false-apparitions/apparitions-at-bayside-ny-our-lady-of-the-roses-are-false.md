title: Apparitions At Bayside, NY ("Our Lady Of The Roses") Are False

<p>We’re often contacted by those who follow the alleged apparitions of Our Lady and Our Lord that have occurred in various parts of the world over the past few decades.  Among these, the apparitions at Bayside, New York are prominent.  Veronica Lueken allegedly received messages from Our Lord and Our Lady starting in the 1970’s and lasting into the 1990’s.  Veronica’s messages were known as the Message of Bayside, and these messages were – and still are – extremely influential in how many view the post-conciliar crisis.</p>

<p align="center">Veronica Lueken in "ecstasy" at Bayside, NY - As we will see, she was seeing something, but not Our Lady or Our Lord</p>
<p>The messages allegedly received by Veronica were accompanied by prodigies and signs that were witnessed by many at the Bayside apparition site.  Below is a picture from the grounds at Bayside, in which there appears to be a miraculous sign of grace in the area of Veronica Lueken’s head.  Apparently there are thousands of such pictures from the grounds at Bayside.  These indeed appear to be “signs,” but, as we will see, these signs are not from heaven.</p>

<p align="center">A sign at Bayside - but, as we will see, not a sign from heaven</p>
<p>Speaking of the last days, Our Lord warns the world that there will be false signs and wonders to deceive (if it were possible) even the elect.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Matthew 24:24-25: "<strong><em>Then if any man shall say to you: Lo here is Christ, or there, do not believe him</em></strong><em>. For there shall arise false Christs and <strong>false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders, insomuch as to deceive (if possible) even the elect</strong></em>. <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Behold I have told it to you, before hand</span></em>.  If therefore they shall say to you: Behold he is in the desert, go ye not out: Behold he is in the closets, believe it not."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this warning, Our Lord makes the very specific statement that <strong>if people say they see Him here or there in those days, do not believe it</strong>.  He even uses the very interesting phrase, “in the closet.”  In other words, if they say that Our Lord is appearing to them in their closets or in their rooms, do not believe it.  (This admonition would obviously apply also to those who say that His Mother is here or there in those days.)  St. Paul warns us of the same thing 2 Thessalonians, when speaking about the time of the Great Apostasy and the coming of Antichrist:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2 Thessalonians 2:9-12: "Whose coming is according to the working of Satan, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">in all power, and signs, and lying wonders</span></strong>, And in all seduction of iniquity to them that perish; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">because they receive not the love of the truth</span>, that they might be saved. Therefore God shall send them the operation of error, to believe lying. That all may be judged who have not believed the truth, but have consented to iniquity."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Faced with this situation, the way that a Catholic judges everything is by the teaching of the Catholic Church.  If an apparition gives a message that contains one clear heresy, or anything contrary to the teaching of the Catholic Church, that is sufficient to prove that it cannot be from God, but from the devil.  God does not contradict Himself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Galatians 1:8-9 “But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach a gospel to you besides that which we have preached to you, let him be anathema.  As we said before, so now I say again: If anyone preach to you a gospel, besides that which you have received, let him be anathema.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So here are some of the heresies and clearly false messages in Bayside, which serve to prove that the apparitions of Bayside were not authentic messages from Our Lady or Our Lord.  What follows are just a few of the false messages in Bayside.  There are many others which I will not include in order to avoid making this article too long.  These facts are sufficient to prove that Our Lord and Our Lady did not appear or speak to Veronica Lueken.  <strong>It was actually the Devil posing as Our Lady and Our Lord who gave Veronica Lueken false messages in order to lead people astray.</strong></p>
<p align="center">BAYSIDE TEACHES THAT THERE ARE OTHER FAITHS IN HEAVEN</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Our Lady” of Bayside, August 14, 1979: “Do not judge your brothers and sisters who have not been converted.  For My Father’s House, <strong>My Son has repeated over and over, remember always – that in My Father’s House, there are many rooms in the Mansion, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">signifying faiths and creeds</span></strong>.” (<em>Our Lady of the Roses (Blue Book)</em>, the “messages” of Bayside, published by Apostles of Our Lady, Inc. Lansing, MI, 1993, p. 81.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The statement above allegedly from “Our Lady of Bayside,” that in the Father’s House <em>there are many mansions representing</em> <em>many faiths and creeds, </em>is blatantly heretical.  It is an infallibly defined dogma that only those who die with the Catholic Faith go to heaven.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Eugene IV, The Athanasian Creed, <em>Council of Florence</em>, Sess. 8, Nov. 22, 1439, <em>ex cathedra</em>: “<strong>Whoever wishes to be saved, needs above all to hold the Catholic faith; </strong>unless each one preserves this whole and inviolate, he will without a doubt perish in eternity.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This heresy in Bayside gives it away as a false apparition of the Devil, for Our Lady does not contradict infallible dogma and the Chair of St. Peter.  To say otherwise is blasphemous heresy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Leo XII, <em>Ubi Primum</em> (# 14), May 5, 1824: <strong>“<span style="text-decoration: underline;">It is impossible for the most true God</span></strong>, who is Truth itself, the best, the wisest Provider, and the Rewarder of good men, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">to approve all sects who profess false teachings</span></strong> which are often inconsistent with one another and contradictory, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">and to confer eternal rewards on their members</span></strong>… <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">by divine faith we hold one Lord, one faith</span>, one baptism</strong>… <strong>This is why we profess that there is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">no</span> salvation outside the Church.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bayside Message contradicts what Catholics must hold by divine faith, that there is only one faith that leads to heaven, the Catholic Faith, outside of which there is no salvation.  The <em>many mansions</em> in the Father’s house that Our Lord refers to in the Gospel represent different rewards for Catholics who die in the state of grace.</p>
<p align="center">BAYSIDE’S FALSE PROPHECY ON THE MARKET CRASH</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Our Lady” of Bayside, June 18, 1988: “Within two years or less, there will be a great crash of the market.  The whole world’s monetary systems will be paralyzed.  That, My child, is why you had to come this evening to the grounds.” (<em>Our Lady of the Roses (Blue Book)</em>, p. 108.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This never happened.</p>
<p align="center">BAYSIDE’S FALSE PROPHECY ON THE BALL OF REDEMPTION</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Our Lady” of Bayside, June 18, 1988: “Do not be affrighted, My child; you must see this, for it is important.  Within this century this Ball will be sent upon mankind… It is almost too late… a Ball that is fast hurtling towards earth!  It will be here within this century, if not sooner.” (<em>Our Lady of the Roses (Blue Book)</em>, p. 108.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A common characteristic of many of the recent false apparitions is the claim that a ball of redemption will come to crush the earth or much of it.  Personally, I believe that the Devil’s purpose in promoting this idea is to get people to focus on a physical chastisement, rather than on the spiritual deception occurring with the Vatican II sect.  Bayside clearly prophesied that this comet/ball of redemption would arrive “within” the 20th century.  <strong>This never happened</strong>, thus proving that the Message of Bayside is false.  Further, look at the wording of the message allegedly from “Our Lady.”  She supposedly says that this ball would arrive “within this century, if not sooner,” AS IF SHE DOESN’T KNOW.  It is not the statement of Our Lady, but the lie of the devil.</p>
<p>When Our Lady communicates, she usually says very little.  She expresses herself precisely, and she certainly doesn’t make false prophecies.  She is the Queen of Prophets.</p>
<p align="center">BAYSIDE TEACHES HERESY ON GOD’S POWERS, AND THAT JOHN PAUL II WAS GOOD</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Our Lord” of Bayside, August 21, 1985: “My children – three figures with great power, who are planning the fate of your Vicar [John Paul II].  You must warn him to be clear of those about him.  When he reads their writings he will understand.  However, <strong>We also ask that he spend less time in going to and fro across the nations, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">for he makes it doubly difficult for Us to protect him</span></strong>.  Pray a constant vigilance of prayer.  You have a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">good and holy Father</span> now in Rome, but should he be removed there will come disaster.” (<em>Our Lady of the Roses (Blue Book)</em>, the “messages” of Bayside, published by Apostles of Our Lady, Inc. Lansing, MI, 1993, p. 103.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to this, Our Lord said that it’s doubly hard for Him to protect someone who travels.  This is clearly false.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Pius IX, <em>Vatican Council I</em>, Sess. 3, Chap. 1, On God the creator of all things: “EVERYTHING THAT GOD HAS BROUGHT INTO BEING HE PROTECTS AND GOVERNS BY HIS PROVIDENCE, <em>which reaches from one end of the earth to the other and orders all things well</em>.  <em>All things are open and laid bare before His eyes</em>, even those which will be brought about by the free activity of creatures.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>God’s providence and power extend from one end of the earth to the other.  It’s not hard for Him to do anything.  The statement of Bayside not only contradicts Vatican I, but also the Gospel.  Our Lord tells His Apostles that He could instantly have more than 12 legions of angels (Mt. 26:53) from His Father, if He asked for them.  But according to Bayside, it makes it difficult on God if you travel.  This is just one example of many which proves that there is outrageous heresy and error in the Bayside Message.</p>
<p><strong>While God allows the Devil to work false signs at these apparition sites, at the same time He allows (or even forces) the Devil to make major mistakes, so that those who really want the truth can see that the message is a deception of the Devil.  </strong></p>
<p>The above message also tells us that John Paul II was “good.”  This is arguably the worst part of the Bayside Message.  John Paul II praised all the different false religions and taught that we shouldn’t convert non-Catholics, as our material documents.  John Paul II was an evil, Christ-rejecting heretic.  Through Veronica Lueken, the Devil wanted to convince people that a man who preached a new Gospel, promoted idolatry and religious indifferentism was actually “good.”</p>

<p align="center"> BAYSIDE TEACHES CLEAR FALSEHOOD ON THE TELEVISION</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Our Lady” of Bayside, Sept. 27, 1975: “I have, many times, cautioned you, and all My children, against the use of the diabolical machine, your television.  <strong>There will be no excuses for having these in your presence</strong>.” (<em>Our Lady of the Roses (Blue Book)</em>, the “messages” of Bayside, published by Apostles of Our Lady, Inc. Lansing, MI, 1993, p. 86.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the Message of Bayside, “Our Lady” says that there are no excuses for having a television in your presence.  This is clearly ridiculous.  That means that one could never watch a Catholic video or the news or some other perfectly acceptable program.  Our Lady would certainly condemn the misuse of the television, and most things on television; but this statement of Bayside is clearly false, and it contradicts the teaching of Pope Pius XI in <em>Vigilanti Cura</em>, June 29, 1936.</p>
<p>Speaking of motion pictures (movies) – and therefore what he says obviously applies to the television as well – Pius XI points out the “<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">potentialities for good</span> as well as for harm</strong>.”  Movies and the television are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> intrinsically evil; they can be used for good or for evil.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Pius XI, <em>Vigilanti cura</em> (#18), June 29, 1936: “The power of the cinema is due to the fact that it speaks through the medium of living images, which are assimilated with delight and without difficulty, even by those who are untrained and uneducated, and who would be incapable or unwilling to make the efforts of induction or deduction necessary in reasoning.  For to read, or to listen to another reading aloud demands a certain concentration and mental effort; an effort which in the cinema is replaced by the delight of a continuous stream of living images presented to the eyes….These theatres, being like the school of life itself, have a greater influence in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">inciting men to virtue or vice</span> than abstract reasoning.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s interesting that Pius XI points out that watching a movie requires less mental effort than reading a book, which is why movies and the television are so popular.  Most people are unwilling to make the mental effort it requires to read.  Since this continuous stream of living images is presented directly to the eyes by a motion picture, Pius XI points out that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">it possesses great power to incite men</span> “<strong>to virtue or vice…</strong>”  Thus, movies and television <em>can</em> lead men to virtue, if the program is wholesome and Catholic.  Movies and television are not intrinsically evil.  The Message of Bayside is proven again to be false.</p>
<p align="center">BAYSIDE’S FALSE PROPHECY ON THE ONE FOLLOWING JOHN PAUL II</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Our Lady” of Bayside, June 18, 1988: “Please, My children, pray for your Holy Father, the Pope.  You must not lose him, for the one who comes after him will destroy if he can – he will attempt to destroy Pope John Paul II.” (<em>Our Lady of the Roses (Blue Book)</em>, p. 108.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is another false prophecy.  The one after John Paul II, Benedict XVI, doesn’t try to destroy him, but wants to “canonize” him!  Further, the prophecy is inherently contradictory, for how could the one after John Paul II attempt to destroy him when John Paul II will already be dead?</p>
<p align="center">THE REAL PURPOSE OF THE FALSE BAYSIDE MESSAGES: STAY IN YOUR PARISH AT THE INVALID NEW MASS AND WITH THE ANTIPOPE</p>
<p align="center"><img decoding="async" id="_x0000_i1030" src="https://vaticancatholic.com/Article_pictures/granthillnewmass.jpg" alt="“Our Lady” of Bayside promotes the New Mass" width="237" height="200" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Our Lady” of Bayside, Aug. 14, 1981, STAY IN YOUR PARISH: “My heart, My Son’s heart has been grieved, as we go about the world… We can see a division bordering on schism… it is promoted by Satan… Do not judge My Son’s House, His Church, by the man, though he is a representative – legal, a legal representative of My Son… at the time that My Son comes in the Consecration, He shall not turn aside from you, My Son.  Therefore, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">you cannot say that the Mass is invalid</span></strong>.  <strong>This has brought great sorrow to Our Hearts, for many left the fold on this matter</strong>.” (<em>Our Lady of the Roses (Blue Book)</em>, p. 83.)</p>
<p>“Our Lady” of Bayside, May 3, 1978, Stay in your parish: “<strong>You will all remain in your Parish Churches</strong>.” (<em>Our Lady of the Roses (Blue Book)</em>, p. 83.)</p>
<p>“Our Lady” of Bayside, Aug. 14, 1981, Stay in your parish: “I have asked you in the past, and I ask and continue to beg you, My children<strong>, not to abandon your Vicar in Rome</strong>, and <strong>not to abandon your parish church</strong>.” (<em>Our Lady of the Roses (Blue Book)</em>, p. 83.)</p>
<p>“Our Lord” of Bayside, Sept. 14, 1986, Traditionalists are being led astray: “We hear all names coming forward to Our ears of churches being born anew, called the Traditional Roman Catholic Church.  My child and My children, <strong>We need no more Traditionalists running around</strong> and creating new churches.” (<em>Our Lady of the Roses (Blue Book)</em>, p. 104.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Devil wants people to stay with the counterfeit Church of the Vatican II sect.  He wants people to stay with the invalid New Mass.  This is the whole purpose of the Bayside Messages, and many similar false messages.  The Devil wants to keep conservative-minded “Catholics” inside the Vatican II parishes, in communion with the new Vatican II religion, and under the manifestly heretical and non-Catholic Vatican II antipopes.  In order to accomplish this, the Devil uses false seers such as Veronica Lueken.  And in order to be ultra-effective, in the false messages that he gives them he includes conservative statements.  These conservative statements, such as encouraging the people to pray the Rosary, wear the Scapular, denounce Modernism, reject liturgical abuses, etc., are meant to deceive.  All of these things were part of the Bayside messages.  And because people receive not the love of the truth (2 Thess. 2), God allows them to be deceived by the false signs that have occurred at these apparition sites.</p>
<p>Sadly, the Devil’s plan has been incredibly effective.  We’ve been in contact with many who continue to attend the New Mass – while deploring its abuses, of course, as the Bayside Message instructs them – simply because they believe in Bayside.  They won’t hear Magisterial arguments which show that the New Mass is no Mass; rather, they just stick with Bayside.  They dismiss all the proof that Paul VI, John Paul II and Benedict XVI aren’t even Catholic; they just stick with Bayside.  I know of entire families who have been raised in the Conciliar religion – for instance, attending both the indult Mass and the New Mass, rather than strictly the Traditional Mass at an independent chapel – simply because they follow Bayside.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it will cost them their salvation, since they have chosen to follow strange voices rather than the truth communicated through the teaching of the Catholic Church.  At their judgments, Our Lord will repeat to them what He warned all of us in the Gospel:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Matthew 24:24-25: "Then if any man shall say to you: Lo here is Christ, or there, do not believe him. For there shall arise false Christs and false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders, insomuch as to deceive (if possible) even the elect. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Behold I have told it to you, before hand</span>.  If therefore they shall say to you: Behold he is in the desert, go ye not out: Behold he is in the closets, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">believe it not</span>."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Below is just one of countless examples that could be given of a “conservative” message that the Devil spiced in among the Bayside messages.  The Devil tells them to remain at the Vatican II parish and under the antipope, while also…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Our Lady” of Bayside, Aug. 14, 1974 – Vatican II: “Satan was present – He listened with careful ears at the Great Council [Vatican II].  He awaited every move, and he placed his agents among you! Recognize and reconstruct your path!  You have been deluded.” (<em>Our Lady of the Roses (Blue Book)</em>, p. 87.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This tickles the ears of those who know that Vatican II caused the spiritual crisis.  So the Devil tells them that there were problems with Vatican II, while keeping them in the very sect that Vatican II created.  It’s brilliant.  Veronica also said that it was revealed to her that if the Latin Mass were returned the coming chastisement would be averted.  Hence, the people are told that the Latin Mass is preferable, but the New Mass is also valid and should not be abandoned.</p>
<p align="center">VERONICA LUEKEN WAS A VOICE-BOX FOR THE DEVIL</p>
<p align="center"><img decoding="async" id="_x0000_i1029" src="https://vaticancatholic.com/Article_pictures/veronica_4.jpg" alt="“Our Lady” of Bayside and Veronica Lueken deception" width="50%" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Our Lady” of Bayside, July 25, 1985: “…By the time We had reached you in Bayside, in your home, My Child, We had looked with Theresa a long time for a Veronica….the highest of heaven approach many souls to be messengers, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">voice-boxes</span></strong>, for the Eternal Father, through My Son…” (<em>Our Lady of the Roses (Blue Book)</em>, p. 102.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Veronica Lueken was chosen and used as a voice-box for the Devil.  Her false messages, which contradict Catholic teaching, have had disastrous effects on innumerable souls.  For the most part, what is said in this article also applies to the many other false apparitions of the past few decades.  It applies to the false apparitions at Medjugorje, which contain clear heresy; it applies to the false apparitions/locutions to Don Gobbi, John Leary, etc., etc., etc.  Some of these other apparitions are slightly more conservative, while some of them are slightly more liberal.  The Devil has various flavors to appeal to different kinds of people, but they all deliver a false message on the post-Vatican II apostasy.  Almost all of them say similar things about John Paul II.</p>
<p>In conclusion, these facts should show us the lengths to which Satan has gone (with God’s permission) to deceive people and keep them with the New Mass and the Vatican II antipopes, etc.<strong>  This should be a wake up call to us all about the gravity of the spiritual deception we are dealing with now.</strong></p>
