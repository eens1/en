<p>The following statements on Outside the Catholic Church There is No Salvation are from the highest teaching authority of the Catholic Church.&nbsp; They are <em>ex cathedra</em> Papal decrees (decrees from the Chair of St. Peter).&nbsp; Therefore, they constitute the teaching given to the Catholic Church by Jesus Christ and the Apostles.&nbsp; Such teachings are unchangeable and are classified as part of the solemn magisterium (the extraordinary teaching authority of the Catholic Church).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pope Innocent III, <em>Fourth Lateran Council</em>, Constitution 1, 1215, <strong><em>ex cathedra</em></strong>: <strong>“There is indeed one universal Church of the faithful, outside of which nobody at all is saved</strong>, in which Jesus Christ is both priest and sacrifice.”<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Pope Boniface VIII, <em>Unam Sanctam</em>, Nov. 18, 1302, <strong><em>ex cathedra</em></strong>:<br>“With Faith urging us we are forced to believe and to hold the one, holy, Catholic Church and that, apostolic, and we firmly believe and simply confess <strong>this Church</strong> <strong>outside of which there is no salvation nor remission of sin… Furthermore, we declare, say, define, and proclaim to every human creature that they by absolute necessity for salvation are entirely subject to the Roman Pontiff.”</strong><a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a></p>
<p>Pope Clement V, <em>Council of Vienne</em>, Decree # 30, 1311-1312, <strong><em>ex cathedra</em></strong>:<br><span style="font-size: inherit;">“Since however there is for both regulars and seculars, for superiors and subjects, for exempt and non-exempt, </span><strong style="font-size: inherit;"><em>one universal Church, outside of which there is no salvation</em></strong><span style="font-size: inherit;">, for all of whom there is </span><em style="font-size: inherit;">one Lord, one faith, and one baptism</em><span style="font-size: inherit;">…”</span><a style="font-size: inherit;" href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>Pope Eugene IV, <em>Council of Florence</em>, Sess. 8, Nov. 22, 1439, <em>ex cathedra</em>:<br><span style="font-size: inherit;">“</span><strong style="font-size: inherit;">Whoever <em>wishes</em> to be saved, needs above all to hold the Catholic faith; unless each one preserves this whole and inviolate, he will without a doubt perish in eternity</strong><span style="font-size: inherit;">.”</span><a style="font-size: inherit;" href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4">[4]</a></p>
<p>Pope Eugene IV, <em>Council of Florence</em>, “Cantate Domino,” 1441, <strong><em>ex cathedra</em></strong>:<br><strong>“The Holy Roman Church firmly believes, professes and preaches that all those who are outside the Catholic Church, not only pagans but also Jews or heretics and schismatics, cannot share in eternal life and will go into the everlasting fire which was prepared for the devil and his angels, unless they are joined to the Church before the end of their lives</strong>; that the unity of this ecclesiastical body is of such importance that only for those who abide in it do the Church’s sacraments contribute to salvation and do fasts, almsgiving and other works of piety and practices of the Christian militia produce eternal rewards; and that <strong>nobody can be saved, no matter how much he has given away in alms and even if he has shed blood in the name of Christ, unless he has persevered in the bosom and unity of the Catholic Church.”</strong><a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5">[5]</a></p>
<p>Pope Leo X, <em>Fifth Lateran Council</em>, Session 11, Dec. 19, 1516, <strong><em>ex cathedra</em></strong>:<br>“For, regulars and seculars, prelates and subjects, exempt and non-exempt, belong to the <strong>one universal Church, outside of which no one at all is saved</strong>, and they all have <em>one Lord and one faith</em>.”<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6">[6]</a></p>
<p>Pope Pius IV, <em>Council of Trent</em>, “Iniunctum nobis,” Nov. 13, 1565, <strong><em>ex cathedra</em></strong>: <strong><em>“This true Catholic faith, outside of which no one can be saved</em></strong>… I now profess and truly hold…”<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7">[7]</a></p>
<p>Pope Benedict XIV, <em>Nuper ad nos</em>, March 16, 1743, Profession of Faith: <strong>“This faith of the Catholic Church, without which no one can be saved</strong>, and which of my own accord I now profess and truly hold…”<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8">[8]</a></p>
<p>Pope Pius IX, <em>Vatican Council I</em>, Session 2, Profession of Faith, 1870, <strong><em>ex cathedra</em></strong>: “<strong>This true Catholic faith, outside of which none can be saved</strong>, which I now freely profess and truly hold…”<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9">[9]</a></p>
