<p><strong><u>OBJECTION-</u></strong> Our Lady herself revealed at Bayside and Medjugorje that non-Catholics can be saved, so you are wrong.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Our Lady” of Bayside, August 14, 1979: “Do not judge your brothers and sisters who have not been converted.&nbsp; For My Father’s House, <strong>My Son has repeated over and over, remember always – that in My Father’s House, there are many rooms in the Mansion, <u>signifying faiths and creeds</u></strong>.”<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><u>ANSWER</u></strong><strong>- </strong>Our Lady does not contradict infallible dogma and the Chair of St. Peter.&nbsp; To say otherwise is blasphemous heresy.&nbsp; The statement above allegedly from “Our Lady of Bayside,” that in the Father’s House <em>there are many mansions representing</em> <em>many faiths and creeds, </em>is blatantly heretical.&nbsp; It contradicts Catholic dogma, which is the teaching of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; This heresy in Bayside totally gives away the Bayside Message as a false apparition of the Devil.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Leo XII, <em>Ubi Primum</em> (# 14), May 5, 1824:<br><strong>“<u>It is impossible for the most true God</u></strong>, who is Truth itself, the best, the wisest Provider, and the Rewarder of good men, <strong><u>to approve all sects who profess false teachings</u></strong> which are often inconsistent with one another and contradictory, <strong><u>and to confer eternal rewards on their members</u></strong>… <strong><u>by divine faith we hold one Lord, one faith</u>, one baptism</strong>… <strong>This is why we profess that there is <u>no</u> salvation outside the Church.”</strong><a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bayside Message contradicts what Catholics must hold by divine faith, that there is only one faith that leads to Heaven, the Catholic Faith, outside of which there is no salvation.&nbsp; The <em>many mansions</em> in the Father’s house that Our Lord refers to in the Gospel represent different rewards for Catholics who die in the state of grace.&nbsp; Those who continue to believe in Bayside and dismiss these facts are following the deception of the Devil; they are rejecting the Catholic Faith and leaving the Catholic Church.&nbsp; They are choosing to follow the “Message” of Bayside over the teaching of the Catholic Church.&nbsp; Those who are aware of this heresy and continue to believe in Bayside are not Catholics and not followers of Our Lady, but rather are followers of the deception the Devil has set up for them.</p>
<p>And it is sad to say, but for many followers of false apparitions such as Bayside, the false messages become their “dogma” and replace the real dogma defined by the popes.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>What Does Medjugorje Say?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Madonna always stresses that there is but one God and that people have enforced unnatural separation. <strong>One cannot truly believe, be a true Christian, if he does not respect other religions as well</strong>."<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[3]</a> – "Seer" Ivanka Ivankovic</p>
<p><sup>&nbsp;</sup>"The Madonna said that religions are separated in the earth, <strong>but the people of all religions are accepted by her Son</strong>."<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4">[4]</a> – "Seer" Ivanka Ivankovic</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Question: "Is the Blessed Mother calling all people to be Catholic?" Answer: "No. The Blessed Mother says <u>all religions are dear to her and her Son</u>."</strong><a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5">[5]</a> – "Seer" Vicka Ivankovic</p>
<p>This is total apostasy.&nbsp; It is a total rejection of Catholic dogma; it is a total rejection of the dogma Outside the Catholic Church There is No Salvation; and it is a total rejection of the clear teaching of the Gospel on the necessity of believing in Jesus Christ, the Son of God, for salvation.&nbsp; This proves that Medjugorje, like the rest of the false modern apparitions, is a deception of the Devil.&nbsp; Those who are aware of these facts and refuse to reject it as a false apparition are rejecting the Catholic Faith.</p>
