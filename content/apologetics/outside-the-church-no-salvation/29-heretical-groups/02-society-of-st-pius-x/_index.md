<p><strong><u>OBJECTION</u></strong>-  The Society of Saint Pius X has published numerous books and articles which show that baptism of desire is the teaching of the Catholic Church, such as <em>Baptism of Desire</em> by Fr. Jean-Marc Rulleau and <em>Is Feeneyism Catholic?</em> by Fr. Francois Laisney.</p>

<p><strong><u>ANSWER</u></strong>- I have already shown that the teaching of Pope St. Leo the Great, the Council of Florence on John 3:5, and the Council of Trent on John 3:5 and the Sacrament of Baptism (among many other things) disprove any claim that salvation can be attained without water baptism.  But I will address the books of the Society of St. Pius X in this regard.  The Society of Saint Pius X (SSPX), founded by the late Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, has spread heresy publicly on the necessity of the Catholic Church for salvation, and has attacked with heretical tenacity Catholics who defend the Church’s infallible teaching on the necessity of Baptism.  The arguments that the Society of St. Pius X brings forward are refuted in this book.  But to fully expose the heresy – and shocking dishonesty – which is easily detected in their works, I will examine a few of their books in detail.</p>

<p>I will give a brief overview of the heresies present in the writings of Archbishop Lefebvre, followed by a more in-depth exposé of the SSPX’s recent works.</p>
