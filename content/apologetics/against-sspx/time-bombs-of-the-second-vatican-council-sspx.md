<blockquote>
<p>Fr. Schmidberger (SSPX), <em>Time Bombs of the Second Vatican Council</em>, 2005, p. 10: “Ladies and gentlemen, <strong>it is clear that the followers of other religions can be saved under certain conditions</strong>, that is to say, if they are in invincible error.”<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fr. Schmidberger says “it’s clear” that the followers of non-Catholic religions can be saved!  No, what is clear is how directly the above statement denies Catholic dogma!  This is more <u>blatant heresy</u> taught in a widely-circulated pamphlet of the SSPX.</p>
