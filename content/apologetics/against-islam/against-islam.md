<blockquote>
<p>Pope Eugene IV, <em>Council of Basel</em>, Session 19, Sept. 7, 1434:<br />“… there is hope that very many from <strong><u>the abominable sect of Mahomet</u></strong> will be converted to the Catholic faith.”<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Pope Callixtus III, 1455: “I vow to… exalt the true Faith, and to extirpate <strong>the diabolical sect of the reprobate and faithless Mahomet</strong> [Islam] in the East.”<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Catholic Church considers Islam an “abominable” and “diabolical” sect.  [Note: the Council of Basel is only considered ecumenical/approved in the first 25 sessions, as <em>The Catholic Encyclopedia</em> points out in Vol. 4, “Councils,” pp. 425-426.]  An “abomination” is something that is abhorrent in God’s sight; it’s something that He has no esteem for and no respect for.  Something “diabolical” is something of the Devil.  Islam rejects, among many other dogmas, the Divinity of Jesus Christ and the Trinity.  Its followers are outside the pale of salvation so long as they remain Muslims.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Clement V, <em>Council of Vienne</em>, 1311-1312:<br />“<strong>It is an insult to the holy name and a disgrace to the Christian faith</strong> that in certain parts of the world subject to Christian princes where Saracens [i.e., the followers of Islam, also called Muslims] live, sometimes apart, sometimes intermingled with Christians, the Saracen priests, commonly called Zabazala, in their temples or mosques, in which the Saracens meet to adore <strong>the infidel Mahomet</strong>, loudly invoke and extol his name each day at certain hours from a high place… There is a place, moreover, where once was buried a certain Saracen whom other Saracens venerate as a saint.  <strong><u>This brings disrepute on our faith and gives great scandal to the faithful.</u></strong><u>  <strong>These practices cannot be tolerated without displeasing the divine majesty</strong></u>.  We therefore, with the sacred council’s approval, strictly forbid such practices henceforth in Christian lands.  <strong>We enjoin on Catholic <u>princes</u>, one and all</strong>… They are to remove this offense together from their territories and take care that their subjects remove it, so that they may thereby attain the reward of eternal happiness.  <strong><u>They are to forbid expressly the public invocation of the sacrilegious name of Mahomet</u></strong>… Those who presume to act otherwise are to be so chastised by the princes for their irreverence, that others may be deterred from such boldness.”<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[3]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While the Church teaches that all who die as non-Catholics are lost, it also teaches that no one should be forced to embrace baptism, since belief is a free act of the will. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Leo XIII, <em>Immortale Dei</em> (#36), Nov. 1, 1885: “And, in fact, the Church is wont to take earnest heed that no one shall be forced to embrace the Catholic faith against his will, for, as St. Augustine wisely reminds us, ‘Man cannot believe otherwise than of his own will.’”<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4">[4]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The teaching of the <em>Council of Vienne</em> that Christian princes should enforce their civil authority to forbid the public expression of the false religion of Islam shows again that Islam is a false religion which leads souls to Hell (not Heaven) and displeases God.</p>
