<p>2 Peter 2:1- “But there were also false prophets among the people, <strong>even as there shall be among you lying teachers, who shall bring in sects of perdition</strong>, and deny the Lord who bought them: bringing upon themselves swift destruction.”</p>

<p>Following Martin Luther’s excommunication from the Catholic Church in 1520, which marked the beginning of the Protestant movement, over 20,000 different denominations have been created in about 500 years.&nbsp; <strong>In 1980, David A. Barrett’s <em>World Christian Encyclopedia</em> (Oxford University Press) gave the number of different denominations as 20,780</strong>.&nbsp; He projected that there would be 22,190 denominations by 1985.</p>
<p>This would mean that there are approximately 25,000 (or possibly 30,000) different denominations today.&nbsp; Even if, for the sake of argument, one were to take a conservative estimate, and give the number as only 15,000 different denominations, this equates to more than one new sect having been created every two weeks.</p>
<p>When we consider the fact that the original founders of Protestantism didn’t even agree with each other on major points of doctrine, such denominational chaos shouldn’t be a surprise.&nbsp; Protestantism is man-made religion, in which each person ultimately determines for himself what he thinks the Bible teaches.&nbsp; Martin Luther (the initiator of Protestantism) condemned the doctrinal views of John Calvin and Huldrych Zwingli, two other leading Protestant figures.&nbsp; They all claimed to follow the Bible.</p>
<p>Basically all of these thousands of non-Catholic sects purport to be Christian and claim to follow the Bible, even though they disagree with each other on crucial doctrinal matters, such as: the precise nature of justification; whether human works and sins are a part of salvation; whether men have free will; predestination; whether infants need baptism for salvation; what Communion is; whether it’s necessary to confess to the Lord; which books of the New Testament apply to us today; the structure of the Church’s hierarchy; the role of bishops and ministers; the Sabbath; the role of women in church; etc. <em>ad nauseam</em>.&nbsp; Most of these groups even claim that the individual “Christian” will be led by the Holy Spirit when privately reading the Bible.&nbsp; The disunity of these sects constitutes an irrefutable proof that their doctrine is not of the Spirit of Truth; and that their principle of operation (i.e.., Scripture alone apart from the Church and Tradition) is not the doctrine of the Bible and the Apostles.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ephesians 4:4-5- “One body and one Spirit; as you are called in one hope of your calling.&nbsp; One Lord, <strong>one faith</strong>, one baptism.”</p>
