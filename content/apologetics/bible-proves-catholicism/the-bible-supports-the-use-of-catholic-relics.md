<p>“And God wrought by the hand of Paul more than common miracles: So that even there were brought from his body to the sick handkerchiefs and aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the wicked spirits went out of them.  <strong>Now some also of the Judean exorcists, who went about, attempted to invoke over them, that had evil spirits, the name of the Lord Jesus, saying: I conjure you by Jesus, whom Paul preaches.  </strong>And there were certain men, seven sons of Sceva, a Jew, a chief priest, who did this.  <strong>But the evil sprit answering, said to them: Jesus I know, and Paul I know: but who are you?  And the man, in whom the evil spirit was, leaping upon them, and mastering them both, prevailed against them,</strong> so that they fled out of that house wounded and naked.” (Acts 19:11-16)</p>
