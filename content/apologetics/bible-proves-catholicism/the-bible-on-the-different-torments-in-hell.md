<p>St. Alphonsus (c. 1755): <strong>“Sacred Scripture enumerates a number of other torments which will afflict the damned [besides hellfire].  One of these is the ‘worm,’ to which the Scriptures refer frequently… </strong>most theologians explain it metaphorically as the remorse of conscience which will afflict the damned in the fire and darkness of hell.  <strong>Forever will they have imprinted on their memories the results of their sins; forever will they repeat the words ascribed to the damned in the book of Wisdom: ‘We have erred from the way of truth, we wearied ourselves in the way of iniquity and destruction and have walked through hard ways.  What hath pride profited us?  Or what advantage hath the boasting of riches brought us?... Such as these the sinners said in hell’ </strong>(Wisdom 5:6-14).”</p>
