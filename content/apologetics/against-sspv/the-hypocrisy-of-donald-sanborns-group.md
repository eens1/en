<p>MHFM: It’s remarkable to see certain blind supporters of Donald Sanborn’s pseudo-sedevacantist group denounce the ‘Recognize and Resist’ position, while they fail to realize that Sanborn’s group holds the ‘Recognize and Resist’ position. Yes, Sanborn’s group holds the Cassiciacum Thesis, according to which all the Novus Ordo ‘cardinals’ (including Jorge Bergoglio) are true Catholic cardinals! Yet they resist communion with their ‘Catholic cardinals’, they reject the ‘pope’ (i.e. Bergoglio) who is recognized by their ‘cardinals’, and they resist the special privileges that Catholic cardinals enjoy according to canon 239 of the 1917 Code of Canon Law (such as the ability to preach anywhere). Are there bigger hypocrites in the ‘traditionalist’ movement? Their obstinate supporters (who claim to be sedevacantists) are exceedingly foolish.</p>
