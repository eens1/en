<p>In Greek θεότης is a word that refers to the one Godhead, the deity, the divine nature.&nbsp; It is regularly used by the Greek fathers to refer to the one Godhead, i.e. the divine essence common to the three persons.&nbsp; For example, in his Fifth Theological Oration, St. Gregory Nazianzen says: “for the Godhead is One” (μία θεότης).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>St. Athanasius says: “There is <strong>one eternal Godhead</strong> in Trinity (<strong>άῖδιος καὶ μία Θεότης</strong> ἐστίν ἐν Тριάδι)...” (<em>First Discourse Against The Arians, #18</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the New Testament (i.e. Colossians 2:9), the genitive form of the word (θεότητος) is used in reference to Our Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp; That’s because Jesus Christ is true God, in addition to true man.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Colossians 2:9- “For in him the whole fullness <strong>of deity [θεότητος]</strong> dwells bodily.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Council of Chalcedon and the Second Council of Constantinople use θεότης to refer to the one Godhead/divinity of the three divine persons.&nbsp; The θεότης of all three divine persons is the same.&nbsp; However, the heretic Gregory Palamas, whose theology has been adopted by the Eastern 'Orthodox', rejected the truth that there is one θεότης.&nbsp; Palamas distinguished between a higher θεότης (the divine essence) and a lower θεότης (the ‘uncreated energies’).&nbsp; Palamas referred to them as θεότης ὑπερκειμένη (the divinity lying above) and θεότης ὑφειμένη (a divinity that is lower).</p>
<p>That is heretical, for there is only one θεότης.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Second Council of Constantinople, 553, Canon 1: “If anyone does not confess one nature or essence of Father and Son and Holy Spirit, and one power and authority, a consubstantial Trinity to be worshipped as <strong><em>one Godhead in three hypostases or persons</em></strong>, let such a one be anathema.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Palamas' heretical formulation wasn't just a mistake in terminology or a loose application of the word.&nbsp; It reflected a heretical belief that manifests itself in many of his statements.&nbsp; Consequently, besides the reference to a “lower θεότης”, there are many expressions in Palamas' writings that are heretical.&nbsp; Another example is his assertion that energies which “begin” are “uncreated”.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gregory Palamas, <em>The Triads</em>: “… we for our part know that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><em>while</em></strong> <strong><em>all the energies of God are uncreated, not all are without beginning</em></strong></span>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is heretical nonsense, for everything that begins to exist is created.</p>
