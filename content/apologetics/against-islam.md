title: "Against Islam"
---

Islam considers Jesus to be a prophet, but denies His divinity. Yet Jesus Himself claimed on numerous occasions that He is God (John 8:58, John 10:30, John 14:6, etc.). If Jesus was not God, then claiming to be God when He is not would make Him a false prophet. This proves that Islam is a false religion and that its teaching is patently illogical.
