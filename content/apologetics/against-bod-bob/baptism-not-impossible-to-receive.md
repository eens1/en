<p><strong><u>OBJECTION-</u></strong>&nbsp; Baptism of desire supporters assert that <strong>for some people the command to be baptized is simply impossible to fulfill</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><u>ANSWER</u></strong><strong>- </strong>God does not command impossibilities (<em>de fide</em>).&nbsp; Thus, it is not impossible for any man to get baptized.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Catechism of the Council of Trent, On Baptism, Tan Books, p. 171:<br>"Holy writers are unanimous in saying that after the Resurrection of our Lord, <strong>WHEN HE GAVE HIS APOSTLES <u>THE COMMAND</u></strong> to go and teach all nations: baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, <strong><u>THE LAW OF BAPTISM became obligatory on all who were to be saved</u></strong>."</p>
<p>Pope Paul III, <em>Council of Trent</em>, Session 6, Chap. 11 on Justification, <em>ex cathedra</em>: "... no one should make use of that rash statement forbidden under anathema by the Fathers, that the commandments of God are impossible to observe for a man who is justified. ‘<strong><u>FOR GOD DOES NOT COMMAND IMPOSSIBILITIES</u></strong>, but by commanding admonishes you both to do what you can do, and to pray for what you cannot do…’"<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a></p>
