      <description>1 A psalm for David himself. Mercy and judgment I will sing to thee, O Lord: I will sing,
2 And I will understand in the unspotted way, when thou shalt come to me. I walked in the innocence of my heart, in the midst of my house.
3 I will not set before my eyes any unjust thing: I hated the workers of iniquities.
4 The perverse heart did not cleave to me: and the malignant, that turned aside from me, I would not know.</description>

      <description>1 The prayer of the poor man, when he was anxious, and poured out his supplication before the Lord.
2 Hear, O Lord, my prayer: and let my cry come to thee.
3 Turn not away thy face from me: in the day when I am in trouble, incline thy ear to me. In what day soever I shall call upon thee, hear me speedily.
4 For my days are vanished like smoke, and my bones are grown dry like fuel for the fire.</description>

      <description>1 For David himself. Bless the Lord, O my soul: and let all that is within me bless his holy name.
2 Bless the Lord, O my soul, and never forget all he hath done for thee.
3 Who forgiveth all thy iniquities: who healeth all thy diseases.
4 Who redeemeth thy life from destruction: who crowneth thee with mercy and compassion.
5 Who satisfieth thy desire with good things: thy youth shall be renewed like the eagle&amp;rsquo;s.</description>

      <description>1 For David himself. Bless the Lord, O my soul: O Lord my God, thou art exceedingly great. Thou hast put on praise and beauty:
2 And art clothed with light as with a garment. Who stretchest out the heaven like a pavilion:
3 Who coverest the higher rooms thereof with water. Who makest the clouds thy chariot: who walkest upon the wings of the winds.
4 Who makest thy angels spirits: and thy ministers a burning fire.</description>

      <description>1 Give glory to the Lord, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.

5 That we may see the good of thy chosen, that we may rejoice in the joy of thy nation: that thou mayst be praised with thy inheritance.</description>

      <description>1 Give glory to the Lord, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.
2 Let them say so that have been redeemed by the Lord, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy: and gathered out of the countries.
3 From the rising and from the setting of the sun, from the north and from the sea.
4 They wandered in a wilderness, in a place without water: they found not the way of a city for their habitation.</description>

      <description>1 A canticle of a psalm for David himself.
2 My heart is ready, O God, my heart is ready: I will sing, and will give praise, with my glory.

4 I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people: and I will sing unto thee among the nations.
5 For thy mercy is great above the heavens: and thy truth even unto the clouds.</description>

      <description>1 Unto the end, a psalm for David.
2 O God, be not thou silent in my praise: for the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful man is opened against me.
3 They have spoken against me with deceitful tongues; and they have compassed me about with words of hatred; and have fought against me without cause.
4 Instead of making me a return of love, they detracted me: but I gave myself to prayer.</description>

      <description>1 A psalm for David. The Lord said to my Lord: Sit thou at my right hand: Until I make thy enemies thy footstool.
2 The Lord will send forth the sceptre of thy power out of Sion: rule thou in the midst of thy enemies.
3 With thee is the principality in the day of thy strength: in the brightness of the saints: from the womb before the day star I begot thee.</description>

      <description>1 I will praise thee, O Lord, with my whole heart; in the council of the just, and in the congregation.
2 Great are the works of the Lord: sought out according to all his wills.
3 His work is praise and magnificence: and his justice continueth for ever and ever.
4 He hath made a remembrance of his wonderful works, being a merciful and gracious Lord:

2 His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the righteous shall be blessed.
3 Glory and wealth shall be in his house: and his justice remaineth for ever and ever.
4 To the righteous a light is risen up in darkness: he is merciful, and compassionate and just.
5 Acceptable is the man that sheweth mercy and lendeth: he shall order his words with judgment:</description>

      <description>1 When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a barbarous people:
2 Judea was made his sanctuary, Israel his dominion.
3 The sea saw and fled: Jordan was turned back.
4 The mountains skipped like rams, and the hills like the lambs of the flock.
5 What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou didst flee: and thou, O Jordan, that thou wast turned back?
6 Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams, and ye hills, like lambs of the flock?</description>

      <description>1 I have loved, because the Lord will hear the voice of my prayer.
2 Because he hath inclined his ear unto me: and in my days I will call upon him.
3 The sorrows of death have compassed me: and the perils of hell have found me. I met with trouble and sorrow:
4 And I called upon the name of the Lord. O Lord, deliver my soul.
5 The Lord is merciful and just, and our God sheweth mercy.</description>

      <description>1 I have believed, therefore have I spoken; but I have been humbled exceedingly.
2 I said in my excess: Every man is a liar.
3 What shall I render to the Lord, for all the things that he hath rendered to me?
4 I will take the chalice of salvation; and I will call upon the name of the Lord.
5 I will pay my vows to the Lord before all his people:</description>

      <description>1 Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the Lord.
2 Blessed are they that search his testimonies: that seek him with their whole heart.
3 For they that work iniquity, have not walked in his ways.
4 Thou hast commanded thy commandments to be kept most diligently.
5 O! that my ways may be directed to keep thy justifications.
6 Then shall I not be confounded, when I shall look into all thy commandments.</description>

2 O Lord, deliver my soul from wicked lips, and a deceitful tongue.
3 What shall be given to thee, or what shall be added to thee, to a deceitful tongue?
4 The sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals that lay waste.

4 Behold he shall neither slumber nor sleep, that keepeth Israel.

      <description>1 A gradual canticle. I rejoiced at the things that were said to me: We shall go into the house of the Lord.
2 Our feet were standing in thy courts, O Jerusalem.
3 Jerusalem, which is built as a city, which is compact together.
4 For thither did the tribes go up, the tribes of the Lord: the testimony of Israel, to praise the name of the Lord.
5 Because their seats have sat in judgment, seats upon the house of David.</description>

      <description>1 To thee have I lifted up my eyes, who dwellest in heaven.
2 Behold as the eyes of servants are on the hands of their masters, As the eyes of the handmaid are on the hands of her mistress: so are our eyes unto the Lord our God, until he have mercy on us.
3 Have mercy on us, O Lord, have mercy on us: for we are greatly filled with contempt.</description>

      <description>1 A gradual canticle. If it had not been that the Lord was with us, let Israel now say:
2 If it had not been that the Lord was with us, When men rose up against us,
3 Perhaps they had swallowed us up alive. When their fury was enkindled against us,
4 Perhaps the waters had swallowed us up.
5 Our soul hath passed through a torrent: perhaps our soul had passed through a water insupportable.</description>

      <description>1 A gradual canticle. They that trust in the Lord shall be as mount Sion: he shall not be moved for ever that dwelleth
2 In Jerusalem. Mountains are round about it: so the Lord is round about his people from henceforth now and for ever.
3 For the Lord will not leave the rod of sinners upon the lot of the just: that the just may not stretch forth their hands to iniquity.</description>

      <description>1 A gradual canticle. When the Lord brought back the captivity of Sion, we became like men comforted.
2 Then was our mouth filled with gladness; and our tongue with joy. Then shall they say among the Gentiles: The Lord hath done great things for them.
3 The Lord hath done great things for us: we are become joyful.
4 Turn again our captivity, O Lord, as a stream in the south.</description>

      <description>1 A gradual canticle of Solomon. Unless the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it. Unless the Lord keep the city, he watcheth in vain that keepeth it.
2 It is vain for you to rise before light, rise ye after you have sitten, you that eat the bread of sorrow. When he shall give sleep to his beloved,
3 Behold the inheritance of the Lord are children: the reward, the fruit of the womb.</description>

      <description>1 A gradual canticle. Blessed are all they that fear the Lord: that walk in his ways.
2 For thou shalt eat the labours of thy hands: blessed art thou, and it shall be well with thee.
3 Thy wife as a fruitful vine, on the sides of thy house. Thy children as olive plants, round about thy table.
4 Behold, thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the Lord.</description>

      <description>1 Unto the end, a psalm for David. To thee, O Lord, have I lifted up my soul.
2 In thee, O my God, I put my trust; let me not be ashamed.
3 Neither let my enemies laugh at me: for none of them that wait on thee shall be confounded.
4 Let all them be confounded that act unjust things without cause. Shew, O Lord, thy ways to me, and teach me thy paths.</description>

      <description>1 Unto the end, a psalm for David. Judge me, O Lord, for I have walked in my innocence: and I have put my trust in the Lord, and shall not be weakened.
2 Prove me, O Lord, and try me; burn my reins and my heart.
3 For thy mercy is before my eyes; and I am well pleased with thy truth.
4 I have not sat with the council of vanity: neither will I go in with the doers of unjust things.</description>

3 Draw me not away together with the wicked; and with the workers of iniquity destroy me not: Who speak peace with their neighbour, but evils are in their hearts.</description>

      <description>1 Unto the end, in verses, understanding for David.
2 When the men of Ziph had come and said to Saul: Is not David hidden with us?
3 Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me in thy strength.
4 O God, hear my prayer: give ear to the words of my mouth.
5 For strangers have risen up against me; and the mighty have sought after my soul: and they have not set God before their eyes.</description>

      <description>1 Unto the end, in verses, understanding for David.
2 Hear, O God, my prayer, and despise not my supplication:
3 Be attentive to me and hear me. I am grieved in my exercise; and am troubled,
4 At the voice of the enemy, and at the tribulation of the sinner. For they have cast iniquities upon me: and in wrath they were troublesome to me.
5 My heart is troubled within me: and the fear of death is fallen upon me.</description>

3 I will cry to God the most high; to God who hath done good to me.</description>

2 If in very deed ye speak justice: judge right things, ye sons of men.
3 For in your heart you work iniquity: your hands forge injustice in the earth.
4 The wicked are alienated from the womb; they have gone astray from the womb: they have spoken false things.

      <description>1 A canticle of a psalm for Asaph.
2 O God, who shall be like to thee? hold not thy peace, neither be thou still, O God.
3 For lo, thy enemies have made a noise: and they that hate thee have lifted up the head.
4 They have taken a malicious counsel against thy people, and have consulted against thy saints.
5 They have said: Come and let us destroy them, so that they be not a nation: and let the name of Israel be remembered no more.</description>

      <description>1 Unto the end, in verses. A psalm for David.
2 When I called upon him, the God of my justice heard me: when I was in distress, thou hast enlarged me. Have mercy on me: and hear my prayer.
3 O ye sons of men, how long will you be dull of heart? why do you love vanity, and seek after lying?
