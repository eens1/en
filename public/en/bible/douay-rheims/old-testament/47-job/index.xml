      <description>1 There was a man in the land of Hus, whose name was Job, and that man was simple and upright, and fearing God, and avoiding evil.
2 And there were born to him seven sons and three daughters.
3 And his possession was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a family exceedingly great: and this man was great among all the people of the east.</description>

      <description>1 My soul is weary of my life, I will let go my speech against myself, I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.
2 I will say to God: Do not condemn me: tell me why thou judgest me so?
3 Doth it seem good to thee that thou shouldst calumniate me, and oppress me, the work of thy own hands, and help the counsel of the wicked?</description>

      <description>1 Then Sophar the Naamathite answered, and said:
2 Shall not he that speaketh much, hear also? or shall a man full of talk be justified?
3 Shall men hold their peace to thee only? and when thou hast mocked others, shall no man confute thee?
4 For thou hast said: My word is pure, and I am clean in thy sight.
5 And I wish that God would speak with thee, and would open his lips to thee,</description>

      <description>1 Then Job answered, and said:
2 Are you then men alone, and shall wisdom die with you?
3 I also have a heart as well as you: for who is ignorant of these things, which you know?
4 He that is mocked by his friends as I, shall call upon God and he will hear him: for the simplicity of the just man is laughed to scorn.
5 The lamp despised in the thoughts of the rich, is ready for the time appointed.</description>

      <description>1 Behold my eye hath seen all these things, and my ear hath heard them, and I have understood them all.
2 According to your knowledge I also know: neither am I inferior to you.
3 But yet I will speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God.
4 Having first shewn that you are forgers of lies, and maintainers of perverse opinions.
5 And I wish you would hold your peace, that you might be thought to be wise men.</description>

      <description>1 Man born of a woman, living for a short time, is filled with many miseries.
2 Who cometh forth like a flower, and is destroyed, and fleeth as a shadow, and never continueth in the same state.
3 And dost thou think it meet to open thy eyes upon such an one, and to bring him into judgment with thee?
4 Who can make him clean that is conceived of unclean seed?</description>

      <description>1 And Eliphaz the Themanite, answered, and said:
2 Will a wise man answer as if he were speaking in the wind, and fill his stomach with burning heat?
3 Thou reprovest him by words, who is not equal to thee, and thou speakest that which is not good for thee.
4 As much as is in thee, thou hast made void fear, and hast taken away prayers from before God.</description>

      <guid>/en/bible/douay-rheims/old-testament/47-job/chap016/</guid>
      <description>1 Then Job answered, and said:
2 I have often heard such things as these: you are all troublesome comforters.
3 Shall windy words have no end? or is it any trouble to thee to speak?
4 I also could speak like you: and would God your soul were for my soul.
5 I would comfort you also with words, and would wag my head over you.
6 I would strengthen you with my mouth, and would move my lips, as sparing you.</description>

      <description>1 My spirit shall be wasted, my days shall be shortened and only the grave remaineth for me.
2 I have not sinned, and my eye abideth in bitterness.
3 Deliver me, O Lord, and set me beside thee, and let any man&amp;rsquo;s hand fight against me.
4 Thou hast set their heart far from understanding, therefore they shall not be exalted.
5 He promiseth a prey to his companions, and the eyes of his children shall fail.</description>

      <description>1 Then Baldad the Suhite answered, and said:
2 How long will you throw out words? understand first, and so let us speak.
3 Why are we reputed as beasts, and counted vile before you?
4 Thou that destroyest thy soul in thy fury, shall the earth be forsaken for thee, and shall rocks be removed out of their place?
5 Shall not the light of the wicked be extinguished, and the flame of his fire not shine?</description>

      <description>1 Then Job answered, and said:
2 How long do you afflict my soul, and break me in pieces with words?
3 Behold, these ten times you confound me, and are not ashamed to oppress me.
4 For if I have been ignorant, my ignorance shall be with me.
5 But you set yourselves up against me, and reprove me with my reproaches.
6 At least now understand, that God hath not afflicted me with an equal judgment, and compassed me with his scourges.</description>

      <description>1 And it came to pass, when on a certain day the sons of God came, and stood before the Lord, and Satan came amongst them, and stood in his sight,
2 That the Lord said to Satan: Whence comest thou? And he answered, and said: I have gone round about the earth, and walked through it.
3 And the Lord said to Satan: Hast thou considered my servant, Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a man simple and upright, and fearing God, and avoiding evil, and still keeping his innocence?</description>

      <description>1 Then Sophar the Naamathite answered, and said:
2 Therefore various thoughts succeed one another in me, and my mind is hurried away to different things.
3 The doctrine with which thou reprovest me, I will hear, and the spirit of my understanding shall answer for me.
4 This I know from the beginning, since man was placed upon the earth,
5 That the praise of the wicked is short, and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment.</description>

      <guid>/en/bible/douay-rheims/old-testament/47-job/chap021/</guid>
      <description>1 Then Job answered, and said:
2 Hear, I beseech you, my words, and do penance.
3 Suffer me, and I will speak, and after, if you please, laugh at my words.
4 Is my debate against man, that I should not have just reason to be troubled?
5 Hearken to me and be astonished, and lay your finger on your mouth.
6 As for me, when I remember, I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my flesh.</description>

      <guid>/en/bible/douay-rheims/old-testament/47-job/chap022/</guid>
      <description>1 Then Eliphaz the Themanite answered, and said:
2 Can man be compared with God, even though he were of perfect knowledge?
3 What doth it profit God if thou be just? or what dost thou give him if thy way be unspotted?
4 Shall he reprove thee for fear, and come with thee into judgment:
5 And not for thy manifold wickedness and thy infinite iniquities?
6 For thou hast taken away the pledge of thy brethren without cause, and stripped them naked of their clothing.</description>

      <guid>/en/bible/douay-rheims/old-testament/47-job/chap023/</guid>
      <description>1 Then Job answered, and said:
2 Now also my words are in bitterness, and the hand of my scourge is more grievous than my mourning.
3 Who will grant me that I might know and find him, and come even to his throne?
4 I would set judgment before him, and would fill my mouth with complaints.
5 That I might know the words that he would answer me, and understand what he would say to me.</description>

      <description>1 Times are not hid from the Almighty: but they that know him, know not his days.
2 Some have removed landmarks, have taken away flocks by force, and fed them.
3 They have driven away the ass of the fatherless, and have taken away the widow&amp;rsquo;s ox for a pledge.
4 They have overturned the way of the poor, and have oppressed together the meek of the earth.
5 Others like wild asses in the desert go forth to their work: by watching for a prey they get bread for their children.</description>

      <guid>/en/bible/douay-rheims/old-testament/47-job/chap025/</guid>
      <description>1 Then Baldad the Suhite answered, and said:
2 Power and terror are with him, who maketh peace in his high places.
3 Is there any numbering of his soldiers? and upon whom shall not his light arise?
4 Can man be justified compared with God, or he that is born of a woman appear clean?
5 Behold even the moon doth not shine, and the stars are not pure in his sight.</description>

      <guid>/en/bible/douay-rheims/old-testament/47-job/chap026/</guid>
      <description>1 Then Job answered, and said:
2 Whose helper art thou? is it of him that is weak? and dost thou hold up the arm of him that has no strength?
3 To whom hast thou given counsel? perhaps to him that hath no wisdom, and thou hast shewn thy very great prudence.
4 Whom hast thou desired to teach? was it not him that made life?
5 Behold the giants groan under the waters, and they that dwell with them.</description>

      <description>1 Job also added, taking up his parable, and said:
2 As God liveth, who hath taken away my judgment, and the Almighty, who hath brought my soul to bitterness,
3 As long as breath remaineth in me, and the spirit of God in my nostrils,
4 My lips shall not speak iniquity, neither shall my tongue contrive lying.
5 God forbid that I should judge you to be just: till I die I will not depart from my innocence.</description>

      <description>1 Silver hath beginnings of its veins, and gold hath a place wherein it is melted.
2 Iron is taken out of the earth, and stone melted with heat is turned into brass.
3 He hath set a time for darkness, and the end of all things he considereth, the stone also that is in the dark and the shadow of death.
4 The flood divideth from the people that are on their journey, those whom the food of the needy man hath forgotten, and who cannot be come at.</description>

      <description>1 Job also added, taking up his parable, and said:
2 Who will grant me, that I might be according to the months past, according to the days in which God kept me?
3 When his lamp shined over my head, and I walked by his light in darkness?
4 As I was in the days of my youth, when God was secretly in my tabernacle?
5 When the Almighty was with me: and my servants round about me?</description>

      <description>1 After this, Job opened his mouth, and cursed his day,
2 And he said:
3 Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said: A man child is conceived.
4 Let that day be turned into darkness, let not God regard it from above, and let not the light shine upon it.
5 Let darkness, and the shadow of death, cover it, let a mist overspread it, and let it be wrapped up in bitterness.</description>

      <description>1 But now the younger in time scorn me, whose fathers I would not have set with the dogs of my flock:
2 The strength of whose hands was to me as nothing, and they were thought unworthy of life itself.
3 Barren with want and hunger, who gnawed in the wilderness, disfigured with calamity and misery.
4 And they ate grass, and barks of trees, and the root of junipers was their food.</description>

      <description>1 I made a covenant with my eyes, that I would not so much as think upon a virgin.
2 For what part should God from above have in me, and what inheritance the Almighty from on high?
3 Is not destruction to the wicked, and aversion to them that work iniquity?
4 Doth not he consider my ways, and number all my steps?
5 If I have walked in vanity, and my foot hath made haste to deceit:</description>

      <description>1 So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he seemed just to himself.
2 And Eliu the son of Barachel the Buzite of the kindred of Ram, was angry and was moved to indignation: now he was angry against Job, because he said he was just before God.
3 And he was angry with his friends, because they had not found a reasonable answer, but only had condemned Job.</description>

      <description>1 Hear therefore, O Job, my speeches, and hearken to all my words.
2 Behold now I have opened my mouth, let my tongue speak within my jaws.
3 My words are from my upright heart, and my lips shall speak a pure sentence.
4 The spirit of God made me, and the breath of the Almighty gave me life.
5 If thou canst, answer me, and stand up against my face.</description>

      <description>1 And Eliu continued his discourse, and said:
2 Hear ye, wise men, my words, and ye learned, hearken to me:
3 For the ear trieth words, and the mouth discerneth meats by the taste.
4 Let us choose to us judgment, and let us see among ourselves what is the best.
5 For Job hath said: I am just, and God hath overthrown my judgment.
6 For in judging me there is a lie: my arrow is violent without any sin.</description>

      <description>1 Moreover Eliu spoke these words:
2 Doth thy thought seem right to thee, that thou shouldst say: I am more just than God?
3 For thou saidst: That which is right doth not please thee: or what will it profit thee if I sin?
4 Therefore I will answer thy words, and thy friends with thee.
5 Look up to heaven and see, and behold the sky, that it is higher than thee.</description>

      <description>1 Eliu also proceeded, and said:
2 Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee: for I have yet somewhat to speak in God&amp;rsquo;s behalf.
3 I will repeat my knowledge from the beginning, and I will prove my Maker just.
4 For indeed my words are without a lie, and perfect knowledge shall be proved to thee.
5 God doth not cast away the mighty, whereas he himself also is mighty.</description>

      <description>1 At this my heart trembleth, and is moved out of its place.
2 Hear ye attentively the terror of his voice, and the sound that cometh out of his mouth.
3 He beholdeth under all the heavens, and his light is upon the ends of the earth.
4 After it a noise shall roar, he shall thunder with the voice of his majesty, and shall not be found out, when his voice shall be heard.</description>

      <description>1 Then the Lord answered Job out of a whirlwind, and said:
2 Who is this that wrappeth up sentences in unskilful words?
3 Gird up thy loins like a man: I will ask thee, and answer thou me.
4 Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? tell me if thou hast understanding.
5 Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest or who hath stretched the line upon it?</description>

      <description>1 Knowest thou the time when the wild goats bring forth among the rocks, or hast thou observed the hinds when they fawn?
2 Hast thou numbered the months of their conceiving, or knowest thou the time when they bring forth?
3 They bow themselves to bring forth young, and they cast them, and send forth roarings.
4 Their young are weaned and go to feed: they go forth, and return not to them.</description>

      <description>1 Then Eliphaz, the Themanite, answered, and said:
2 If we begin to speak to thee, perhaps thou wilt take it ill; but who can withhold the words he hath conceived?
3 Behold thou hast taught many, and thou hast strengthened the weary hands:
4 Thy words have confirmed them that were staggering, and thou hast strengthened the trembling knees:
5 But now the scourge is come upon thee, and thou faintest: It hath touched thee, and thou art troubled.</description>

      <description>1 And the Lord answering Job out of the whirlwind, said:
2 Gird up thy loins like a man: I will ask thee, and do thou tell me.
3 Wilt thou make void my judgment: and condemn me, that thou mayst be justified?
4 And hast thou an arm like God, and canst thou thunder with a voice like him?
5 Clothe thyself with beauty, and set thyself up on high, and be glorious, and put on goodly garments.</description>

      <description>1 I will not stir him up, like one that is cruel, for who can resist my countenance?
2 Who hath given me before that I should repay him? All things that are under heaven are mine.
3 I will not spare him, nor his mighty words, and framed to make supplication.
4 Who can discover the face of his garment? or who can go into the midst of his mouth?</description>

      <description>1 Then Job answered the Lord, and said:
2 I know that thou canst do all things, and no thought is hid from thee.
3 Who is this that hideth counsel without knowledge? Therefore I have spoken unwisely, and things that above measure exceeded my knowledge.
4 Hear, and I will speak: I will ask thee, and do thou tell me.
5 With the hearing of the ear, I have heard thee, but now my eye seeth thee.</description>

      <description>1 Call now, if there be any that will answer thee, and turn to some of the saints.
2 Anger indeed killeth the foolish, and envy slayeth the little one.
3 I have seen a fool with a strong root, and I cursed his beauty immediately.
4 His children shall be far from safety, and shall be destroyed in the gate, and there shall be none to deliver them.
5 Whose harvest the hungry shall eat, and the armed man shall take him by violence, and the thirsty shall drink up his riches.</description>

      <description>1 But Job answered, and said:
2 O that my sins, whereby I have deserved wrath, and the calamity that I suffer, were weighed in a balance.
3 As the sand of the sea, this would appear heavier: therefore, my words are full of sorrow:
4 For the arrows of the Lord are in me, the rage whereof drinketh up my spirit, and the terrors of the Lord war against me.</description>

      <description>1 The life of man upon earth is a warfare, and his days are like the days of a hireling.
2 As a servant longeth for the shade, as the hireling looketh for the end of his work;
3 So I also have had empty months, and have numbered to myself wearisome nights.
4 If I lie down to sleep, I shall say: When shall I rise? and again, I shall look for the evening, and shall be filled with sorrows even till darkness.</description>

      <description>1 Then Baldad, the Suhite, answered, and said:
2 How long wilt thou speak these things, and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind?
3 Doth God pervert judgment, or doth the Almighty overthrow that which is just?
4 Although thy children have sinned against him, and he hath left them in the hand of their iniquity:
5 Yet if thou wilt arise early to God, and wilt beseech the Almighty:</description>

      <description>1 And Job answered, and said:
2 Indeed I know it is so, and that man cannot be justified, compared with God.
3 If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one for a thousand.
4 He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath resisted him, and hath had peace?
5 Who hath removed mountains, and they whom he overthrew in his wrath, knew it not.</description>
