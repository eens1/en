      <description>Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;At the end of Mass in the Roman Rite is recited the Last Gospel. These profound words found in the first chapter of the Gospel of St. John are very powerful, striking the reader by the depths of their wisdom and meaning. It is in these very words that we find a provocative argument against baptism of desire:&#xA;John 1:12-13-“But as many as received Him, to them He gave power to become the sons of God: to them that believe in His name: WHO ARE BORN, NOT OF BLOOD, NOR OF THE WILL OF THE FLESH, NOR OF THE WILL OF MAN, BUT OF GOD.</description>

      <description>Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;I introduced my biblically astute Protestant friend to your lesson on Justification. On your major point on Romans 3:28 on the law being a reference to the problem in Galatians, he noted that you have to take every verse in its context, as you, yourself said. He noted that you did not address Rm. 4:1-6 which is the context. Abraham was not dealing with the Jewish law problem in his time.</description>

      <description>Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;In the Acts of the Apostles we read that it was at Antioch that the followers of Christ were first called Christians.&#xA;Acts 11:26- “And they conversed there in the church a whole year; and they taught a great multitude, so that at Antioch the disciples were first named Christians.”&#xA;Interestingly, it was also at Antioch (in the year 110) that the term “Catholic” was first applied to the Christian Church.</description>

      <description>Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;This file contains portions of letters we recently sent to a man who believes that the Blessed Virgin Mary is the Spirit of Wisdom (Sophia) mentioned in the Old Testament. As a result of that position and his view of what Scripture teaches about Wisdom (Sophia) in the Old Testament (e.g., that Wisdom is an emanation from God, can do all things, and was not created out of nothing), he has fallen into numerous heresies opposed to faith in the one God.</description>

      <description>Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;I have been discussing God with several atheists. They brought up a verse I was unaware of. The passage comes from Isaias 45:7: I form the light, and create darkness, I make peace, and create evil: I the Lord that do all these things. Well I know that we are born with original sin and it needs to be removed through water baptism and I realize that we have free will.</description>

And after that I tried to read interesting topics on your site. By the way, I was raised as a Catholic when I was young but I am not sure what kind I belong to since I’ve read that there&#39;s a traditional and new one (I am not that familiar with all the technicalities, sorry about that).</description>

      <description>By Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;Following the Council of Jerusalem in Acts 15, St. Paul returned to Antioch. While in Antioch he had the desire to visit various cities where the word of the Lord had been preached. St. Paul wanted to check on the new converts, to see how they were doing. He originally intended to make this trip with Barnabas, but they had a sharp dispute about whether to bring John Mark with them.</description>

      <description>By Bro. Peter Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;Some people believe that a few verses in the Acts of the Apostles indicate that Cornelius (the first Gentile convert) and his companions were regenerated and justified (or, as some might say, ‘initially saved’) prior to receiving the Sacrament of Baptism. This article will show why this is not the case.&#xA;Acts 10:44-48 says: “While Peter was still saying these things, the Holy Spirit fell on all who heard the word.</description>

      <description>Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;This section moves into the evidence that the Bishop of Rome/the Church of Rome was recognized as supreme in the primitive Christian Church (precisely because it inherited the authority of St. Peter). This section covers the famous epistle of Clement of Rome to the Corinthians (A.D. 90-100) and the famous epistle of Ignatius of Antioch to the Romans (circa A.D. 110). Learn what you probably didn’t know about these most famous documents of early Christianity.</description>

      <description>By Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;Could you please explain a couple of things for me. Where in the bible does it say that Jesus is God in a human form. Everywhere I look it says Jesus is the son of God... Thank you for your time I look forward to your reply.&#xA;Gary&#xA;The “Jehovah’s Witnesses” and the Unitarians deny that Jesus Christ is God. But there are many passages in the Bible which show that Jesus is God.</description>

      <description>By Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;Most Protestants today do not believe that baptism regenerates. This includes Baptists, Presbyterians, Pentecostals, most Evangelicals, and many others.&amp;nbsp; They do not believe that baptism removes sin from the soul and places man in a state of justification.&amp;nbsp; Their position is that water baptism should be performed, but that it’s just a sign of initiation, a sign of a conversion or a spiritual rebirth that has already happened.</description>

      <description>By Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;This is a must-see video. It covers many things people have not heard before. Among numerous other things, this video shows, with an extremely important new argument, how Mary’s sinlessness is actually proven by an epistle of St. Paul and the admissions of Protestants. Among the many issues covered are: Luke 1:28; Ephesians 1:6; the use, meaning and significance of kecharitomene [κεχαριτωμένη], echaritosen [ἐχαρίτωσεν], charitoo [χαριτῶ]; ‘full of grace’; amomous [ἀμώμους]; preservation from sin; Redemption; grace; the meaning and effects of original sin; concupiscence (the ‘fomes peccati’); Old Testament justification; Adam and Eve; regeneration; the teaching of Trent; Mary as the New Eve; Mary as ‘the woman’ of Genesis 3:15; Mary as the New Ark; episkiazo [ἐπισκιάζω]; Mary’s name; the vocative case; the ‘seed of the woman’; ploutos [πλοῦτος]; and much more.</description>
