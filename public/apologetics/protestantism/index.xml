      <description>By Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;This is a new video. The first part of this video covers what is probably the best argument that has been made against the Reformed Protestant position of justification by faith alone. This argument was originally released and contained in our documentary on justification (which also dealt with many other related matters). However, this new video delves into and examines more angles of the argument.</description>

      <description>By Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;This video, although it focuses primarily on one man, covers many extremely important topics that are relevant to multitudes. Thus we strongly encourage people to watch all of it. Note that one section of this video (from 1:23:36 to 1:45:41) is the video that we previously posted called Mary: Mother Of God &amp;amp; Ark Of The New Covenant. If you’ve already seen that video, and you come to that section in this video and wish to pass over it, note that the new content resumes at the 1:45:41 mark.</description>

      <title>Are Catholic Statues Idolatrous?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/apologetics/protestantism/04-catholics-worship-statues/</link>

      <description>Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;… I recently read some of the post in your website and I have started it when I found a video in YouTube entitled Is the World about to End? And after that I tried to read interesting topics on your site. By the way, I was raised as a Catholic when I was young but I am not sure what kind I belong to since I’ve read that there&#39;s a traditional and new one (I am not that familiar with all the technicalities, sorry about that).</description>

      <title>Documentary: Protestantism&#39;s Big Justification Lie</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/apologetics/protestantism/01-justification-bible-faith-alone-refuted/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/apologetics/protestantism/01-justification-bible-faith-alone-refuted/</guid>
      <description>By Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;This is a must-see new documentary. Among many other things, it explains, examines, and refutes the historic Protestant teaching on Justification (and Forensic Justification) by exposing a fatal flaw at its core. It reveals a devastating new argument and disproves the Protestant position by using the words of the Protestants themselves. It shows that the key salvation doctrine of the Protestant ‘Reformation’ is fundamentally contradictory.</description>

      <title>Does Ephesians 2:8 say “saved through faith” or “saved through THE FAITH”?</title>

      <description>By Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;In our video, Can a Christian Lose Salvation? – 1 Corinthians, we point out that the same phrase in Greek – “through the faith” (διὰ τῆς πίστεως) – is found in Colossians 2:12, Galatians 3:26 and Ephesians 2:8. Colossians 2:12, Galatians 3:26-27 and Ephesians 2:8 all deal with entrance into Christ, the reception of initial salvation/regeneration, and the forgiveness of sins. The video shows that Colossians 2:12 and Galatians 3:26-27 teach that entering Christ Jesus “through the faith” (διὰ τῆς πίστεως), and being raised “through the faith”, happens with the reception of Baptism.</description>

      <title>Is Saturday or Sunday the Holy Day?</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/apologetics/protestantism/09-saturday-or-sunday-holy-day-sabbath/</guid>
      <description>By Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;Why true Christians (i.e., Catholics) dedicate Sunday specifically to God, rather than Saturday Refuting Seventh-Day Adventists and Seventh-Day Baptists from the Bible Exodus 20:8-11- &#34;Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a sabbath of the Lord your God; in it you shall not do any work, you or your son or your daughter, your male or your female servant or your cattle or your sojourner who stays with you.</description>

      <title>Is the King James Bible Infallible?</title>

      <description>By Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;KING JAMES ONLYISM EXPOSED Bro. Peter Dimond&#xA;I recently studied numerous books on the King James Bible, its history, and the controversy surrounding it. There are many facts we need to consider. Knowing these facts sheds necessary light on the so-called ‘Christians’ who believe that the 1611 King James Version of the Bible is infallible (the KJV-Onlyists), the false doctrine of sola scriptura, and Protestantism in general.</description>

      <description>By Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;This is a very important and interesting debate against a full-time Reformed Protestant (Calvinist) apologist. This man is highly motivated and extremely anti-Catholic. He has spent much time producing materials dedicated to attacking the Catholic faith, including films. Many very important issues and facts are covered in this debate.</description>

      <description>By Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;This is a must-see video. It covers many things people have not heard before. Among numerous other things, this video shows, with an extremely important new argument, how Mary’s sinlessness is actually proven by an epistle of St. Paul and the admissions of Protestants. Among the many issues covered are: Luke 1:28; Ephesians 1:6; the use, meaning and significance of kecharitomene [κεχαριτωμένη], echaritosen [ἐχαρίτωσεν], charitoo [χαριτῶ]; ‘full of grace’; amomous [ἀμώμους]; preservation from sin; Redemption; grace; the meaning and effects of original sin; concupiscence (the ‘fomes peccati’); Old Testament justification; Adam and Eve; regeneration; the teaching of Trent; Mary as the New Eve; Mary as ‘the woman’ of Genesis 3:15; Mary as the New Ark; episkiazo [ἐπισκιάζω]; Mary’s name; the vocative case; the ‘seed of the woman’; ploutos [πλοῦτος]; and much more.</description>

It also exposes a number of very interesting facts about how Martin Luther rejected numerous books of the New Testament. It also discusses numerous problems with the false Protestant doctrine of sola scriptura.</description>
