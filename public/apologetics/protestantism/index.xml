      <description>Source: vaticancatholic.com&amp;quot;&#xA;This is a must-see new documentary. Among many other things, it explains, examines, and refutes the historic Protestant teaching on Justification (and Forensic Justification) by exposing a fatal flaw at its core. It reveals a devastating new argument and disproves the Protestant position by using the words of the Protestants themselves. It shows that the key salvation doctrine of the Protestant ‘Reformation’ is fundamentally contradictory. It thus serves to refute and expose the entire Protestant &#39;Reformation&#39;.</description>

      <description>By Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;2 Peter 2:1- “But there were also false prophets among the people, even as there shall be among you lying teachers, who shall bring in sects of perdition, and deny the Lord who bought them: bringing upon themselves swift destruction.”&#xA;Following Martin Luther’s excommunication from the Catholic Church in 1520, which marked the beginning of the Protestant movement, over 20,000 different denominations have been created in about 500 years.</description>

      <description>By Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;If you are a Lutheran, your religion was founded by Martin Luther, an ex-monk of the Catholic Church, in approximately 1520.&#xA;If you belong to the Church of England, your religion was founded by King Henry VIII (an ex-Catholic) in the year 1534.&amp;nbsp; Henry VIII decided to create his own church when Pope Clement VII would not grant him a divorce with the right to remarry.</description>

      <description>By Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;Must-See Documentary: Protestantism’s Big Justification Lie (video)&#xA;The overwhelming majority of Protestants believe that the Bible teaches that people are justified (put into a state in which they will be saved) by faith alone in Jesus – i.e., apart from a consideration of their actions, deeds or sins. Most of them also believe in “once saved always saved” or eternal security: that a man who believes in Jesus cannot lose his eternal salvation.</description>

      <description>By Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;Protestantism originated with Martin Luther (1483-1546), an ex-Catholic.&amp;nbsp; Even though Protestants would contend that they follow “true biblical Christianity,” and not a man, they are inclined to defend Martin Luther.&amp;nbsp; This is because Martin Luther was the first identifiable spokesman for their version of “Christianity.”&amp;nbsp; Prior to his separation from the Catholic Church in 1520, there was no public defender of what we now know to be Protestantism, the core doctrines of which are justification by faith alone and Scripture alone.</description>

      <description>By Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;2 Thessalonians 2:15- “Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle.”&#xA;According to Protestants, the Bible teaches that Scripture (the written word of God) is the only rule of faith for a Christian. Along with justification by faith alone (sola fide), Scripture alone (sola scriptura) was one of the central tenets of the Protestant “reformation.</description>

      <description>By Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;This is a new video. The first part of this video covers what is probably the best argument that has been made against the Reformed Protestant position of justification by faith alone. This argument was originally released and contained in our documentary on justification (which also dealt with many other related matters). However, this new video delves into and examines more angles of the argument.</description>

      <description>By Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;This video, although it focuses primarily on one man, covers many extremely important topics that are relevant to multitudes. Thus we strongly encourage people to watch all of it. Note that one section of this video (from 1:23:36 to 1:45:41) is the video that we previously posted called Mary: Mother Of God &amp;amp; Ark Of The New Covenant. If you’ve already seen that video, and you come to that section in this video and wish to pass over it, note that the new content resumes at the 1:45:41 mark.</description>

      <description>Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;… I recently read some of the post in your website and I have started it when I found a video in YouTube entitled Is the World about to End? And after that I tried to read interesting topics on your site. By the way, I was raised as a Catholic when I was young but I am not sure what kind I belong to since I’ve read that there&#39;s a traditional and new one (I am not that familiar with all the technicalities, sorry about that).</description>

      <description>By Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;In our video, Can a Christian Lose Salvation? – 1 Corinthians, we point out that the same phrase in Greek – “through the faith” (διὰ τῆς πίστεως) – is found in Colossians 2:12, Galatians 3:26 and Ephesians 2:8. Colossians 2:12, Galatians 3:26-27 and Ephesians 2:8 all deal with entrance into Christ, the reception of initial salvation/regeneration, and the forgiveness of sins. The video shows that Colossians 2:12 and Galatians 3:26-27 teach that entering Christ Jesus “through the faith” (διὰ τῆς πίστεως), and being raised “through the faith”, happens with the reception of Baptism.</description>

      <description>By Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;Why true Christians (i.e., Catholics) dedicate Sunday specifically to God, rather than Saturday Refuting Seventh-Day Adventists and Seventh-Day Baptists from the Bible Exodus 20:8-11- &#34;Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a sabbath of the Lord your God; in it you shall not do any work, you or your son or your daughter, your male or your female servant or your cattle or your sojourner who stays with you.</description>

      <description>By Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;KING JAMES ONLYISM EXPOSED Bro. Peter Dimond&#xA;I recently studied numerous books on the King James Bible, its history, and the controversy surrounding it. There are many facts we need to consider. Knowing these facts sheds necessary light on the so-called ‘Christians’ who believe that the 1611 King James Version of the Bible is infallible (the KJV-Onlyists), the false doctrine of sola scriptura, and Protestantism in general.</description>

      <description>By Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;This is a very important and interesting debate against a full-time Reformed Protestant (Calvinist) apologist. This man is highly motivated and extremely anti-Catholic. He has spent much time producing materials dedicated to attacking the Catholic faith, including films. Many very important issues and facts are covered in this debate.</description>
