<p>The seemingly <u>bottomless pit of scandal</u> produced by the Vatican II sect in the areas of outrageous New Masses (many of which we have already catalogued), “Catholic” colleges and universities, and the actions of its apostate hierarchy and members, is documented on the internet basically on a daily basis. </p>
<p>Here are just some of the headlines which we have posted in the “News and Commentary” section of our website about the scandal of the Vatican II sect in the past year or so.  Obviously, we cannot reproduce the full articles which corroborated these headlines.  We have endnotes for almost all of the headlines listed here; those without a reference are from real articles that we linked to, but which have been moved to a different place or are no longer stored on the host website.  All of these headlines are <u>real reflections of true occurrences</u> in the Vatican II sect.  <strong><u>More of the same come out every day</u></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>-<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071013170526/http://www.catholic.org/international/international_story.php?id=19634" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Novus Ordo “Cardinal" Cheong of Seoul sends greetings for Buddha’s Birth and says: "We need Buddha's teaching more and more"</a></strong><strong><a href="http://www.catholic.org/international/international_story.php?id=19634">[1]<br /></a></strong></p>
<p>Wow, that’s some apostasy… but the “cardinal” is just following the lead of the Vatican II antipopes.  Remember this one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>John Paul II, May 6, 1984: "… the Korean people throughout history have sought, in the great ethical and religious visions of Buddhism and Confucianism, the path to renewal of self… <strong>May I address a particular greeting to the members of the Buddhist tradition as they prepare to celebrate the festivity of <u>the Coming of the Lord Buddha</u></strong>?  May your rejoicing be complete and your joy fulfilled."<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Pyeonghwa Broadcasting Corporation (PBC), the cable TV station run by Seoul Archdiocese, invited Buddhists to perform the Yeongsanjae ritual at Coste Hall in the Myongdong Cathedral compound on April 19.  The performance was part of a mostly musical program for an audience of about 200 Buddhists and Catholics.</p>
<p>“It marked the first time that Myongdong Cathedral has held such a Buddhist ritual in its compound, according to the cathedral office.”<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[3]</a></p>
<p><strong>-So-called “Catholic priest” denies that Jesus even founded a Church on <em>Larry King Live’s</em> (CNN’s) promotional for “God or the Girl”</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“KING: And Father Manning, did Christ in fact form a church?<br /><br />“MANNING: <strong>Not necessarily</strong>.<br /><br />“KING: Did he die a Jew?<br /><br />“MANNING: As the church -- he was very much that.  We started to move later on in that -- certainly there were the apostles, there were the group.  But, yes, no I agree, yes.<br /><br />“KING: You can chime in, too. You're more than a student.<br /><br />“DEMATTE: Christ -- the Catholic Church does not believe that Christ did not start a church.  The Catholic Church teaches -- we proclaim every day in the creed, we believe in one holy Catholic apostolic church.  We believe in one church, founded by Christ, and that church was founded in Matthew Chapter 16, where Jesus gave Peter the keys to the kingdom of God. <br /><br />“And with that, it goes back to the Old Testament where the Old Testament kings would hand over the keys to the kingdom to the prime minister when that king was going to leave. <br /><br />“And so while Jesus was leaving our kingdom here on earth, he was going to the kingdom of God and he gave his keys over to Peter, the prime -- with primary lead in our church and that's where our papal primacy comes from.  That's where our authority comes from.  And that's where Jesus establishes the church.”<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4">[4]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On April 13, 2006, <em>Larry King Live</em> hosted a program called “God or the Girl” about young men torn between choosing the Novus Ordo “priesthood” or marriage.  It was a promotional for a program by the same title that appeared on another network.  As part of the panel, Larry King had so-called “Catholic priest” Fr. Michael Manning, the host of “The Word in the World.”  Fr. Manning is frequently shown on <em>Larry King Live</em> supposedly to give the official “Roman Catholic” perspective.  Well, as we can see above, when asked whether Jesus even founded a Church, Fr. Manning said “not necessarily,” and that this was formed much later on!  This is such an outrage that one is at a loss for words to comment on it. </p>
<p>One of the young men on the show named Dematte – who is considering the Novus Ordo “priesthood” – actually chimed in, to his credit, and refuted the heresy, as we see in the transcript above.  But this tells us where we are in history, and how far from Catholic the Vatican II sect is: a supposed Catholic priest, featured by CNN to give the official “Catholic” line <strong><u>to millions of viewers</u></strong>, denies that Jesus even founded a Church. </p>

<p>This is a complete mockery of God and the Catholic Faith, but it’s just another day in the Vatican II sect.  Notice that a Novus Ordo “bishop” was fully involved with this outrage.  It was also performed before a more-than-capacity congregation.</p>

<p><strong>-EWTN Priest says that it’s okay to attend Protestant services<a href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22">[22]</a></strong></p>
<p>The EWTN “priest,” Rev. Mark J. Gantley, JCL<strong>, </strong>even agrees that it’s okay to attend a JW or LDS service, which means a Jehovah’s Witness or Mormon service!  Jehovah’s Witnesses reject the Most Holy Trinity.  Mormons allow polygamy and believe that men can become gods.  But, if you believe that the Vatican II “popes” are legitimate, don’t complain about this advice.  This apostate “priest” is just following what is officially taught by John Paul II in #118 of the incredible <em>Directory for the Application of the Principles and Norms of Ecumenism, </em>as we covered earlier.</p>
<p>In # 118, the Directory says that <u>Catholics who attend non-Catholic churches are "encouraged to take part in the psalms, responses, hymns and common actions of the Church in which they are guests</u>."</p>
<p>On March 25, 1993, John Paul II "approved this Directory, confirmed it by his authority and ordered that it be published.  Anything to the contrary notwithstanding."<a href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23">[23]</a></p>
<p>This is why a manifest heretic could never be a true pope.  These people are following the official teachings of the Vatican II religion and they are following it right to Hell!  The authoritative teachings of a true pope don’t lead one to Hell!</p>

<p>Please notice the striking contrast in the picture on the left with Mexico’s “Cardinal” Norberto Rivera and the Dalai Lama.  Above, we see the large crucifix of Our Lord Jesus, while below – like the serpent slithering on the ground – we see his enemy, the Dalai Lama, invading His space and corrupting the children, with the Novus Ordo “cardinal” looking on, encouraging and enabling him.  This picture captures in one shot the striking reality of what has occurred: a phony, antichrist, non-Catholic sect has arisen with Vatican II, and it attempts to eclipse the true Church of Christ (the true Catholic Church), which has been reduced to a remnant of faithful Catholics.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our Lady of La Salette, Sept. 19, 1846: “Rome will lose the faith and become the Seat of the Antichrist… the Church will be in eclipse.”</p>

<p>This article also mentions that “Cardinal” George, the apostate Archbishop of Chicago, has instructed the Novus Ordo “priests” to deny the Rainbow Sash protesters (active homosexuals) Communion.  The Novus Ordo “conservatives” are really emphasizing this fact.  George is considered to be an “ultra-conservative” among the pack of heretics that makes up the Vatican II sect.  Yet George recently celebrated the Muslim holyday of Ramadan in a Mosque together with a group of priests and nuns from his diocese.  The Chicago Tribune noted that George “was the first Chicago archbishop to attend such an event,” and that “as the last verses of the Imam Senad Agic’s melodious prayer resonated under the white and gold dome… clerics and laypeople of both faiths bowed their heads.”<a href="#_edn41" name="_ednref41">[41]</a>  This is utter apostasy, of course.</p>
<p>“Cardinal” George in his diocesan newspaper also wrote that “The Church has also sinned against the Jewish people, first of all, in teaching that God’s covenant with Israel is no longer valid…”<a href="#_edn42" name="_ednref42">[42]</a>  This means that George holds that the Jews have a valid covenant with God and don’t need to convert to the Catholic Faith or Jesus Christ for salvation.  Remember, he’s a “conservative” among the Vatican II sect’s bishops!</p>

<p><strong> </strong>A woman from Anchorage informed us that every Sunday at her parish (for many months during the year), the Novus Ordo “priest” Fr. Patrick Fletcher uses muppets.  “Fr. Kermit” and “Sr. Piggy” emerge from a box on the altar and carry on a dialogue in their distinctive voices in order to instruct the people.  This is truly a new religion and a false religion.</p>

<p><strong>VATICAN CITY</strong> – “In an unusual spectacle at the Vatican, Pope [sic] John Paul II presided Sunday over a performance of break-dancers who leaped, flipped and spun their bodies to beats from a tiny boom box.  The 83-year-old pontiff seemed to approve, waving his hand after each dancer completed a move, then applauding for the entire group.  He watched the performance from a raised throne.  ‘<strong>For this creative hard work I bless you from my heart,’</strong> he said.”<a href="#_edn76" name="_ednref76">[76]</a></p>
<p><span style="font-size: inherit;">-</span><a style="font-size: inherit;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040610132751/http://www.francescoproductions.com/lyrics/lyrics.html"><strong>“Fr.” Stan Fortuna is the Rapping "Priest"</strong></a></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-125555 aligncenter" src="https://vaticancatholic.com/images/stan-fortuna-rapper.jpg" alt="" width="70%" /></p>
<p>The “Rapping Priest,” “Fr.” Stan Fortuna, is promoted even by “conservative” sectors of the Vatican II “Church,” such as EWTN and “Franciscan” University.  <strong>Stan has stated publicly that he was “inspired” to his current activity by John Paul II’s promotion of Rock Music</strong>.  One of his songs is called, “Say Yes to Sex (Theology of the Body).”<a href="#_edn77" name="_ednref77">[77]</a>  Notice that in the photo<a href="#_edn78" name="_ednref78">[78]</a> “Fr.” Stan seems to be giving the <em>El Diablo</em> (the horned Devil sign), which is popular among Satanists and satanic rock groups.  Many give this satanic hand gesture without knowing it because they’re taken over by the evil spirit, as the “Rapping Priest” probably was at this time.  As stated earlier, some point out that the <em>El Diablo</em> (Devil’s horns) sign is similar to the hand gesture for “I love you” in sign language.  That’s true, but that’s probably because the inventor of the deaf signing system, Helen Keller, was herself an occultist and a Theosophist.  She wrote a book called <em>My Religion,</em> in which she explained her occult views.<a href="#_edn79" name="_ednref79">[79]</a>  Some believe that she designed the “I love you sign” to correspond with the horned Devil sign so that the one making it is literally saying that he or she loves Satan.</p>

<p>This was an article about <strong>a Novus Ordo priest who carries off statues to the trash and dresses up as superman or the grinch for "Mass,"</strong> and much more.  What is perhaps almost as bad as this satanic (obviously possessed) priest is that he operates in good standing in his diocese.  His wicked bishop and the Vatican do nothing, but this shouldn’t be a surprise.  He presides over a large Novus Ordo congregation and the numbers of his "church" are growing. </p>
<p>Here are a few quotes from the priest: On life after death, in a 1981 interview:``<em>There's just God and me and you.  No Devil.  No angels.  But there is a Heaven, and Jesus is in it.  And I can't wait to get there</em>.''  On the Rosary: ``<em>I hate the Rosary</em>.''  On himself: "<em>I hope I haven't scandalized you. I wouldn't mind if I did</em>."  On the design of his last church: ``<em>I hired a Jewish architect.  I told him, "If you make it look like a church, I'll kill you</em>.'' </p>
<p>This article not only reminds us how wicked the apostate religion of the Novus Ordo is (something one can tend to forget if one has been removed from this for a long time), but the article shows how (sadly) most of the people at the church are almost as bad as the priest; for they accept and even embrace his antics.  The fact that these people consider themselves "Catholics" and still attend this man's "church" is mind-boggling.  In fact, the article points out how this priest's parishioners are the most dedicated donors in the diocese!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><u>Conclusion on these sections concerning the scandals and unholiness of the Vatican II Counter-Church</u></strong></p>
<p>The headlines and sections that we’ve covered are just the tip of the iceberg.  Examples like the ones covered above could be continued for many pages.  The Vatican II/Novus Ordo sect is characterized by its <strong><u>inexhaustible scandal</u></strong>.  <em>More scandals and acts of unholiness come out almost daily.  Since holiness is one of the marks of the true Church</em>, <em><u>if scandal and immorality are basically  universal</u></em> in a Body which purports to be the true Church, that serves to prove it’s not the true Church and that the true Catholic Faith is also not present.  <strong>And we’ve already proven that the Vatican II sect rejects the true Faith</strong>, and thus cannot be the Catholic Church based on <u>doctrinal grounds</u>.  To sum it up simply: the scandals and unholiness we’ve exposed are <strong><u>the fruits</u></strong> of the heresies and false doctrines embraced by <strong><u>the Counter Church</u></strong>.  And by their fruits you shall know them (Matthew 7:16).  What we have just covered about its inexhaustible scandal <strong>serves to confirm this fact by showing that it’s not the <u>Holy</u> Catholic Church.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Pius IX, <em>Vatican Council I</em>, Sess. 3, Chap. 3, on Faith: “…<strong>the Church itself by itself, because of its marvelous propagation</strong>, <strong><u>its exceptional holiness, and inexhaustible fruitfulness</u></strong> in all good works; because of its Catholic unity and invincible stability, <strong><u>is a very great and perpetual motive of credibility</u></strong>, and <u>an incontestable witness of its own divine mission</u>.”<a href="#_edn83" name="_ednref83">[83]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We must now continue with this theme.  We will now take a closer look at the beliefs of the hierarchy, and some of the prominent members, who are underneath the Vatican II antipopes.</p>
