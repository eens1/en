<blockquote>
<p>Pope Leo XIII, <em>Dall’Alto </em>(# 2), Oct. 15, 1890: “<strong>It is needless now to put the Masonic sects upon their trial</strong>.  They are already judged; their ends, their means, their doctrines, and their action, are all known with indisputable certainty.  <strong>Possessed by the spirit of Satan, whose instrument they are, they burn like him with a deadly and implacable hatred of Jesus Christ and of His work; and they endeavor by every means to overthrow and fetter it</strong>.”<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Pope Leo XIII, <em>In Ipso </em>(# 1), March 3, 1891: “Nevertheless, it grieves us to think that <strong>the <u>enemies of the Church, joined in most wicked conspiracy, scheme to weaken and even, if possible, utterly wipe out</u> that wondrous edifice which God Himself has erected as a refuge for the human race</strong>.”<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s a well known fact that Communists and Freemasons made organized efforts to infiltrate the Catholic Church.  They sent large numbers of their own men into the priesthood hoping to weaken and attack her by moving these men to high positions. </p>
<p>Mrs. Bella Dodd spent most of her life in the Communist Party of America and was Attorney General designate had the Party won the White House.  After her defection, she revealed that one of her jobs as a Communist agent was to encourage young radicals (not always card-carrying Communists) to enter Catholic seminaries.  She said that before she had left the Party in the U.S. she had encouraged almost 1,000 young radicals to infiltrate the seminaries and religious orders; she was only one Communist.<br /><br />Brother Joseph Natale, the founder of Most Holy Family Monastery, was present at one of Bella Dodd’s lectures in the early 1950’s.  He stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I listened to that woman for four hours and she had my hair standing on end.  Everything she said has been fulfilled to the letter.  You would think she was the world’s greatest prophet, but she was no prophet.  She was merely exposing the step-by-step battle plan of Communist subversion of the Catholic Church.  She explained that of all the world’s religions, the Catholic Church was the only one feared by the Communists, for it was its only effective opponent.”<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[3]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bella Dodd converted to Catholicism at the end of her life.  Speaking as an ex-Communist, she said: “<strong>In the 1930’s, we put eleven hundred men into the priesthood in order to destroy the Church from within</strong>.”  The idea was for these men to be ordained, and then climb the ladder of influence and authority as monsignors and bishops.  Back then, she said: “Right now they are in the highest places in the Church.  They are working to bring about change in order that the Catholic Church would not be effective against Communism.”  She also said that these changes would be so drastic that “you will not recognize the Catholic Church.” (This was 10 to 12 years before Vatican II.)</p>
<p>Brother Joseph went on relating what Bella Dodd had said: “<strong>The whole idea was to destroy, not the institution of the Church, but rather the Faith of the people, and even use the institution of the Church, if possible, to destroy the Faith through the promotion of a pseudo-religion</strong>: something that resembled Catholicism but was not the real thing.  Once the Faith was destroyed, she explained that there would be a guilt complex introduced into the Church…  to label the ‘Church of the past’ as being oppressive, authoritarian, full of predjudices, arrogant in claiming to be the sole possessor of truth, and responsible for the divisions of religious bodies throughout the centuries.  This would be necessary in order to shame Church leaders into an ‘openness to the world,’ and to a more flexible attitude toward all religions and philosophies.  The Communists would then exploit this openness in order to undermine the Church.”<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4">[4]</a></p>
<p><strong>Freemasons made similar attempts to infiltrate the Catholic Church</strong> and elevate their own to the highest levels.  The Luciferian secret society, the Carbonari, known as the <em>Alta Vendita</em>, wrote a set of <em>Permanent Instructions</em>, or Code of Rules, which appeared in Italy in 1818.  It stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p> “…It becomes the duty of the secret societies to make the first advance to the Church, and to the pope, with the object of conquering both.  The work for which we gird ourselves is not the work of a day, nor of a month, nor a year.  It may last for many years, perhaps a century… <strong>What we must ask for, what we should look for and wait for, as the Jews wait for the Messiah, is a pope according to our wants</strong>.  We require a pope for ourselves, if such a pope were possible.  With such a one we shall march more securely to the storming of the Church, than with all the little books of our French and English brothers.”<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5"><strong>[5]</strong></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same Freemasonic document made this striking prediction:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In a hundred years time… <strong>bishops and priests will think they are marching behind the banner of the keys of Peter, when in fact they will be following our flag</strong>… The reforms will have to be brought about in the name of obedience.”<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6">[6]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These organizations and the individuals who belong to them are agents which the Devil uses to attack the true Church of Christ.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ephesians 6:12- “For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood; but against principalities and powers, against the rulers of the world of this darkness, against the spirits of wickedness in high places.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On April 3, 1844, a leader of the <em>AltaVendita</em> named Nubius wrote a letter to another highly-placed mason.  <strong>The letter spoke again about the plan to infiltrate the Catholic Church, and the attempt to insert a masonic “pope,”</strong> who would promote the religion of Freemasonry.  “Now then, in order to ensure a pope in the required proportions, we must first of all prepare a generation worthy of the kingdom of which we dream… <strong>Let the clergy move forward under your banner (the masonic banner) always believing they are advancing under the banner of the apostolic keys</strong>.  Cast your net like Simon Bar Jonas; spread it to the bottom of sacristies, seminaries, and convents … You will have finished a revolution dressed in the pope’s triple crown and cape, carrying the cross and the flag, a revolution that will need only a small stimulus to set fire to the four corners of the earth.”<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7">[7]</a></p>
<p>Freemason Eliph Levi said in 1862: “<strong>A day will come when the pope… will declare that all the excommunications are lifted and all the anathemas are retracted</strong>, when all the Christians will be united within the Church, when the Jews and Moslems will be blessed and called back to her . . . she will permit all sects to approach her by degrees and will embrace all mankind in the communion of her love and prayers.  Then, Protestants will no longer exist.  Against what will they be able to protest?  The sovereign pontiff will then be truly king of the religious world, and he will do whatever he wishes with all the nations of the earth.”<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8">[8]</a> </p>
<p>An apostate priest and former canon-lawyer,<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9">[9]</a> named Fr. Roca (1830-1893), after being excommunicated said: “The papacy will fall; it will die under the hallowed knife which the fathers of the last council will forge.”<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10">[10]</a>  Roca also said: “You must have a new dogma, a new religion, a new ministry, and new rituals that very closely resemble those of the surrendered Church.  <strong>The divine cult directed by the liturgy, ceremonial, ritual and regulations of the Roman Catholic Church will shortly undergo transformation at an ecumenical Council</strong>.”<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11">[11]</a>        </p>
