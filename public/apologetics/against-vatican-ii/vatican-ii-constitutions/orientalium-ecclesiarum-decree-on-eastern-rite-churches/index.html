2. Orientalium ecclesiarum – Vatican II’s Decree on Eastern Catholic Churches The Vatican II Decree Orientalium ecclesiarum deals with eastern Catholic churches. It also deals with the Eastern Schismatic sects, the so-called “Orthodox” non-Catholic churches. In dealing with the so-called Orthodox in # 27 of this decree, Vatican II provides us with one of its most significant heresies.
Vatican II document, Orientalium Ecclesiarum # 27: “Given the above-mentioned principles, the sacraments of Penance, Holy Eucharist, and the anointing of the sick may be conferred on eastern Christians who in good faith are separated from the Catholic Church, if they make the request of their own accord and are properly disposed." />

The Vatican II Decree <em>Orientalium ecclesiarum</em> deals with eastern Catholic churches.  It also deals with the Eastern Schismatic sects, the so-called “Orthodox” non-Catholic churches.  In dealing with the so-called Orthodox in # 27 of this decree, Vatican II provides us with one of its most significant heresies.</p>

<td style="border: 1px solid #000000; vertical-align: middle; padding: 5px; height: 10px; text-align: left;" width="319">For 20 centuries the Catholic Church consistently taught that heretics cannot receive the sacraments. This teaching is rooted in the dogma that outside the Catholic Church there is no remission of sins, defined by Pope Boniface VIII. It is also rooted in the dogma that sacraments only profit unto salvation those inside the Catholic Church, as defined by Pope Eugene IV.</td>

<blockquote>
<p>Pope Boniface VIII, <em>Unam Sanctam</em>, Nov. 18, 1302: “With Faith urging us we are forced to believe and to hold the one, holy, Catholic Church and that, apostolic, and we firmly believe and simply confess<strong> this Church</strong> <strong>outside of which there is no salvation nor remission of sin</strong>, the Spouse in the Canticle proclaiming: ‘One is my dove<strong>,</strong> my perfect one.’”<a id="_ednref35" title="" href="#_edn35" name="_ednref35">[35]</a></p>
<p>Pope Eugene IV, <em>Council of Florence</em>, “Cantate Domino,” 1441, <em>ex cathedra</em>: <strong><em>“</em></strong>The Holy Roman Church firmly believes, professes and preaches that all those who are outside the Catholic Church, not only pagans but also Jews or heretics and schismatics, cannot share in eternal life and will go into the everlasting fire which was prepared for the devil and his angels, unless they are joined to the Church before the end of their lives; <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">that the unity of this ecclesiastical body is of such importance that only for those who abide in it do the Church’s sacraments contribute to salvation</span></strong> and do fasts, almsgiving and other works of piety and practices of the Christian militia produce eternal rewards; and that nobody can be saved, no matter how much he has given away in alms and even if he has shed blood in the name of Christ, unless he has persevered in the bosom and unity of the Catholic Church.”<a id="_ednref36" title="" href="#_edn36" name="_ednref36">[36]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Only for those who abide in the Catholic Church do the Church’s sacraments contribute to salvation.  This is a dogma!  But this dogma is repudiated by Vatican II’s outrageous teaching that it is lawful to give Holy Communion to those who do not abide in the Catholic Church.  Popes throughout the ages have proclaimed that non-Catholics who receive the Holy Eucharist outside the Catholic Church receive it to their own damnation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Pius VIII, <em>Traditi Humilitati</em> (# 4), May 24, 1829: “Jerome used to say it this way: <strong>he who eats the Lamb outside this house will perish as did those during the flood who were not with Noah in the ark</strong>.”<a id="_ednref37" title="" href="#_edn37" name="_ednref37">[37]</a></p>
<p>Pope Gregory XVI, <em>Commissum divinitus</em> (# 11), May 17, 1835: “… whoever dares to depart from the unity of Peter might understand that he no longer shares in the divine mystery…‘<strong>Whoever eats the Lamb outside of this house is unholy</strong>.’”<a id="_ednref38" title="" href="#_edn38" name="_ednref38">[38]</a></p>
<p>Pope Pius IX, <em>Amantissimus</em> (# 3), April 8, 1862: “… <strong>whoever eats of the Lamb and is not a member of the Church, has profaned</strong>.”<a id="_ednref39" title="" href="#_edn39" name="_ednref39">[39]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>John Paul II and <a title="The Heresies of Benedict XVI" href="https://vaticancatholic.com/anti-pope-benedict-xvi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Benedict XVI</a> repeated and expanded upon this heresy of Vatican II many times.  In the case of John Paul II, it is taught clearly in his new Code of Canon Law (Canon 844.3-4), in his <em>Directory for the Application of the Principles and Norms of Ecumenism</em> (#’s 122-125) and in his new catechism (#1401).  He also made many references to this heresy in his speeches.</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">John Paul II, <em>General Audience, </em>Aug. 9, 1995: <strong>“Concerning aspects of intercommunion</strong>, the recent Ecumenical Directory confirms and states precisely all that the Council said: that is, <strong>a certain intercommunion is possible, since the Eastern Churches possess true sacraments</strong>, especially the priesthood and the Eucharist.
“On this sensitive point, specific instructions have been issued, stating that, whenever it is impossible for a Catholic to have recourse to a Catholic priest, he may receive the sacraments of Penance, the Eucharist and the Anointing of the Sick from the minister of an Eastern Church (Directory, n. 123).  Reciprocally, <strong>Catholic ministers may licitly administer the sacraments of Penance, the Eucharist and the Anointing of the Sick to Eastern Christians who ask for them.”</strong></p>
<p align="left">John Paul II, <em>Ut Unum Sint </em>(# 48), May 25, 1995: “Pastoral experience shows that with respect to our Eastern brethren there should be and can be taken into consideration various circumstances affecting individuals, wherein the unity of the Church is not jeopardized nor are intolerable risks involved, <strong>but in which salvation itself and the spiritual profit of souls are urgently at issue</strong>.  Hence, in view of special circumstances of time, place and personage, the Catholic Church has often adopted and now adopts a milder policy, offering to all the means of salvation and an example of charity among Christians <strong>through participation in the sacraments and in other sacred functions and objects</strong>… <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">There must never be a loss of appreciation for the ecclesiological implication of sharing in the sacraments, especially the Holy Eucharist</span>.”<a id="_ednref40" title="" href="#_edn40" name="_ednref40"><strong>[40]</strong></a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">Three things are striking in this paragraph: 1) <a title="John Paul II (manifest heretic who claimed to be Pope 1978-2005)" href="https://vaticancatholic.com/anti-pope-john-paul-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Paul II</a> calls for sharing in the sacraments, especially the Holy Eucharist; 2) he attempts to justify this by invoking “the spiritual profit of souls,” which means that he is directly denying the definition of Eugene IV on how reception of the sacraments outside the Church does not profit one unto salvation; 3) <strong>John Paul II reminds us never to forget the “ecclesiological implication” of sharing in the sacraments</strong> – which implication is that these heretics and schismatics with whom they are sharing the sacraments are also in the same Church of Christ!  Does the reader see what this heresy means?  It means that the <a title="Vatican II “Catholic” Church Exposed" href="https://vaticancatholic.com/vatican-ii-exposed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vatican II Church</a>, then headed by Benedict XVI, considers itself in the same Church of Christ with those to whom it gives Holy Communion, the Protestants and the Eastern Schismatics!</p>
<p>Besides its horrible teaching on giving the sacraments to non-Catholics, the Vatican II document <em>Orientalium ecclesiarum</em> spreads more of the heresy of indifferentism: the idea that God approves of all heretical sects.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Vatican II document,<em> Orientalium Ecclesiarum</em> # 30: “They should also pray that the fullness of the strength and solace of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the holy Spirit, the Paraclete, may flow out upon those many Christians of any Church whatsoever</span> who, fearlessly confessing Christ, are undergoing suffering and distress.”<a id="_ednref41" title="" href="#_edn41" name="_ednref41">[41]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Contrary to the heresy of Vatican II, the Holy Spirit does not flow out upon members of any sect whatsoever.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Leo XII, <em>Ubi Primum</em> (# 14), May 5, 1824: “<strong>It is impossible for the most true God</strong>, who is Truth itself, the best, the wisest Provider, and the Rewarder of good men, <strong>to approve all sects who profess false teachings</strong> which are often inconsistent with one another and contradictory, <strong>and to confer eternal salvation on their members</strong>… by divine faith we hold one Lord, one faith, one baptism… <strong>This is why we profess that there is no salvation outside the Church.”<a id="_ednref42" title="" href="#_edn42" name="_ednref42"><strong>[42]</strong></a></strong></p>
<p>Pope St. Celestine I, <em>Council of Ephesus</em>, 431: “… remember that the followers of every heresy extract from inspired scripture the occasion of their error, and that <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">all heretics corrupt the true expressions of the holy Spirit</span></strong> with their own evil minds and they draw down on their heads an inextinguishable flame.”<a id="_ednref43" title="" href="#_edn43" name="_ednref43">[43]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally,operating on the principle that all heretical sects are as good as the Catholic Church, and that the Holy Ghost approves of all heretical sects<em>, Orientalium ecclesiarum</em> calls for Catholics to share their churches with heretics and schismatics.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Vatican II document,<em> Orientalium Ecclesiarum</em> # 28: “With the same principles in mind, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">sharing in sacred functions and things and places is allowed among Catholics and their separated eastern brothers and sisters</span>...”<a id="_ednref44" title="" href="#_edn44" name="_ednref44">[44]</a></p>
