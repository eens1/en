<p style="text-align: center;">“Cardinal” Bernard Law, formerly of Boston, who presided over the Vatican II sect’s massive sexual scandal there</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>CBS News </strong>- Clergy members and others in the Boston Archdiocese likely sexually abused more than 1,000 people over a period of six decades, Massachusetts' attorney general said Wednesday, calling the scandal so massive <strong><u>it "borders on the unbelievable</u>."<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Almost everyone reading this book is probably familiar with the massive sexual scandal among Novus Ordo/Vatican II “priests” that was unceasingly exposed by the mainstream media from approximately 2002-2004.  The sexual perversion of the Novus Ordo/Vatican II “priests” is so pervasive that whole dioceses of the Vatican II sect have gone into bankruptcy to pay out legal settlements to abused victims.  The Diocese of Davenport provides the most recent example. </p>
<p>Traditional Catholics need to seriously consider how severely this scandal has damaged the Catholic Church in the eyes of the world.  Even though we can prove that the Vatican II sect is not the Catholic Church and that the men intimately involved in this scandal adhere to the new religion, not the real Catholic religion – as we will continue to do in this book – for those outside the scandal is seen as coming from “Catholic priests.”  Non-Catholic after non-Catholic uses this priestly sex scandal as a cheap way to attack the true Church and dissuade potential converts.  It is truly one of the worst scandals in human history when we consider the truth of the holy priesthood and the Catholic Faith.</p>
<p>We’ve spoken to so many non-Catholics who, when approached about embracing the truth of the Catholic Faith, have immediately answered back with facts about the Vatican II sect’s pervert priests.  “Why would I want to join a Church whose priests molest children?,” they say (or words to this effect).  In trying to convert people, we’ve been rejected for this reason dozens of times.  People need to realize that <em>the fact that God allowed this massive scandal to occur, which has undoubtedly discouraged millions and will continue to discourage millions from investigating or seeing the Catholic Faith as true</em>, shows us that we are in the time of the Great Apostasy and Great Spiritual deception.  It’s only Catholics who are fully aware of the truth who can take heart in the realization that these priests are not adherents of the true Catholic Faith at all, but adherents of the non-Catholic counterfeit sect.  <strong>This manifestation of perversion is simply the underlying reality of the post-Vatican II apostasy coming out for what it really is.</strong></p>
<p>During “Cardinal” Law's tenure in Boston, Paul Shanley and John Geoghan were moved from parish to parish within the diocese, despite repeated allegations of molestation of children against them.  Later, it was discovered that Father Shanley advocated the North American Man-Boy Love Association.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>BOSTON CONSIDERS BANKRUPTCY </strong>– <strong>The Archdiocese of Boston is reportedly considering filing a claim in U.S. Bankruptcy Court</strong> unless prospects for a mediated settlement improve, the Boston Globe reported Dec. 1… A spokeswoman said the archdiocese has to consider all its options but said there is no timetable for deciding whether to file for bankruptcy. (National Catholic Register, Dec. 8-14, 2002, p. 1.)</p>
<h2><strong>BOSTON</strong><strong> ARCHDIOCESE SELLS OR MORTGAGES ONCE UNTOUCHABLE PROPERTY TO PAY SEX SCANDAL SETTLEMENT <br /></strong></h2>
<p>The Associated Press-</p>
<p><strong>BOSTON (AP) – THE SEX SCANDAL IN THE BOSTON ARCHDIOCESE HAS SHAKEN THE CHURCH ALMOST LITERALLY TO ITS FOUNDATIONS. </strong></p>
<p><strong><u>To help pay the $85 million settlement reached with more than 500 victims of child-molesting priests</u></strong><strong>, <u>the archdiocese has mortgaged its very seat of power -- the Cathedral of the Holy Cross -- and is putting up for sale the archbishop's residence</u>, an Italian Renaissance-style mansion that was a symbol of the church's grandeur and authority. Dozens of churches are also expected to be closed in a move at least accelerated by the scandal. (Dec. 18, 2003)</strong></p>
<p>“<strong><u>And I will accomplish in my fury, and will cause my indignation to rest upon them</u>, and I will be comforted: and they shall know that I the Lord have spoken it in my zeal, when I shall have accomplished my indignation in them.<br /></strong><strong style="font-size: inherit;">     “And I will make thee desolate, <u>and a reproach amongst the nations that are round about thee</u>, in the sight of every one that passeth by.  <u>And thou shalt be a reproach, and a scoff, an example, and an astonishment amongst the nations</u> that are round about thee, when I shall have executed judgments in thee in anger, and in indignation, and in wrathful rebukes.  I the Lord have spoken it…</strong><span style="font-size: inherit;">” (Ezechiel 5:13-16)</span></p>
<p><strong>CBS News </strong>- Clergy members and others in the Boston Archdiocese likely sexually abused more than 1,000 people over a period of six decades, Massachusetts' attorney general said Wednesday, calling the scandal so massive <strong><u>it "borders on the unbelievable</u>."</strong> … The sheer number of abuse allegations documented by investigators <strong><u>in Boston appears unprecedented, even amid a scandal that has touched dioceses in virtually every state</u></strong> and has prompted about 1,000 people to come forward with new allegations nationwide in the last year. (CBSNews.com, July 23, 2003)</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: inherit;">ABC NEWS, Sept. 9</strong><span style="font-size: inherit;">— The Boston Archdiocese and lawyers for victims of sex abuse by priests announced today that they reached a settlement of $85 million, </span><strong style="font-size: inherit;">the largest known payout</strong> <strong style="font-size: inherit;">in the child molestation scandal that has rocked</strong> <strong style="font-size: inherit;">the Roman Catholic Church</strong><span style="font-size: inherit;">. (ABCNews.com, Sept. 9, 2003)</span><strong style="font-size: inherit;"> </strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But this scandal was by no means limited to Boston.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On May 3, 2003, Phoenix Bishop Thomas J. O'Brien acknowledged that he hid allegations of sex abuse by priests.  He then surrendered some of his authority. <a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a></p>
<p>June 28, 2003 – “In one of the largest out-of-court settlements to abuse victims in the Catholic sex scandal, <strong>the Louisville Archdiocese in Kentucky announced that it will pay nearly $25.7 million </strong>to people who said they were sexually molested by priests and other employees of the church… William McMurry, who represented many of the plaintiffs, said that <strong>the archdiocese is using more than half of its liquid assets to pay the settlement</strong>.”<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>On July 6, 2004, “Facing dozens of pending lawsuits accusing clergy of sexual abuse, the Archdiocese of Portland, Ore., files for bankruptcy.  <strong>The Portland church has already paid more than $53 million</strong> to settle more than 130 abuse claims, and the archbishop says, ‘The pot of gold is pretty much empty right now.’”<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4">[4]</a></p>
<p>On Sept. 20, 2004, “The Roman Catholic <strong>Diocese of Tucson</strong>, Ariz., becomes the second in the nation to seek bankruptcy protection, in the wake of extensive and continuing legal action stemming from sexual abuse of children by parish priests.”<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5">[5]</a></p>
<p>On Sept. 24, 2004, “Bishop Thomas Dupre is indicted on child rape charges, becoming the first bishop to face charges in the church sex abuse scandal.  Dupre was the head of the <strong>Springfield</strong><strong>, Mass.</strong> diocese, but resigned in February after the allegations came to light.”<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6">[6]</a></p>
<p><span style="font-size: inherit;">On Dec. 2, 2004, “</span><strong style="font-size: inherit;">The Orange County</strong><span style="font-size: inherit;"> diocese reaches a settlement with 87 victims of clergy abuse.  Terms of the agreement are not disclosed, but a source tells the Associated Press the payout will be bigger than the record $85 million agreement with the Boston Archdiocese.  The lawsuits allege sexual misconduct by 30 priests, 11 lay personnel and two nuns.” </span><a style="font-size: inherit;" href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7">[7]</a></p>
<p><strong>The Diocese of Spokane, WA</strong> “filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in December 2004, listing more than $81 million in claims.  The diocese sought bankruptcy protection in advance of court trials over claims of clergy sexual abuse.”<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8">[8]</a>  In 2006, the Diocese of Spokane auctioned off its chancery to pay off sex abuse claims.<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9">[9]</a></p>
<p>“The child sex abuse scandal in the Roman Catholic <strong>diocese on Long Island </strong>has resulted in the defrocking of eight priests and the permanent suspension of nine [for alleged sex abuse], while three await canonical trials, the bishop of the diocese said.”<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10">[10]</a></p>
<p>On Oct. 12, 2005, “Newly released records of sex abuse <strong>claims against 126 priests</strong> that are at the core of hundreds of lawsuits against the <strong>Archdiocese of Los Angeles</strong> show that church officials for decades moved accused priests between counseling and new assignments.” <a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11">[11]</a></p>
<p>Recently in 2006, “the Roman Catholic <strong>Diocese of Davenport</strong> filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection today, less than two weeks before it defends itself at a trial involving a former priest accused of sexually abusing a high school student.</p>
<p>Bishop William Franklin says he regrets the decision, but the financial pressure and demands for settling as many as 25 outstanding claims of sexual abuse by its priests is too great.“<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12">[12]</a> (IOWA CITY, Iowa)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Examples of this corruption among the Vatican II clergy <u>could be multiplied for pages</u>, but the reader should get the idea: this unspeakable scandal is present among the Vatican sect simply because it’s not the <em>holy</em> Catholic Church.  Who would dare say it is?  The scandal we’re talking about is so outrageous – indeed one of the very worst scandals in history – that <strong>it could only be a sign of the end times and of the apocalyptic counterfeit church which will characterize the last days</strong>.  You know things are bad when the most prominent thing at the top of the website <strong>for the Diocese of Pittsburgh is a toll-free number for sex abuse response</strong>.<a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13">[13]</a></p>
<p><strong> <img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-125261 aligncenter" src="https://vaticancatholic.com/images/site-diocese-pittsburgh.jpg" alt="" width="70%" /></strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>The website for the Archdiocese of Philadelphia has as its fifth option a section on “Children and Youth Protection” <a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14">[14]</a> – protection, that is, from its pervert “priests.”  It’s such a problem that <strong>every diocesan website we checked has a prominent place for the abuse problem</strong>.  What follows are just a few more examples from the diocesan websites of Miami<a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15">[15]</a> and Milwaukee.<a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16">[16]</a>   Notice that the sexual abuse issue is one of the most prominent things mentioned on the websites (underlinig and bracketing are our own).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-125262 aligncenter" src="https://vaticancatholic.com/images/diocese-miami.jpg" alt="" width="70%" /></p>
<p>Nor is the Vatican II sect’s sexual scandal limited to the U.S.  The sexual scandal that has engulfed the Vatican II sect has indeed spread all over the world.  On July 8, 2002, “The Catholic Bishops Conference of <strong>the Philippines</strong> apologizes for ‘grave sexual misconduct’ by Filipino priests, and promises a protocol to address future cases of abuse.”<a href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17">[17]</a></p>
<p>In the Archdiocese of Vienna in 2004, for instance, 10,000 people left the Novus Ordo church in a few months over two high profile sex scandals involving clergy, child pornography and alleged molestation.<a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18">[18]</a></p>
