<p style="text-align: center;">Novus Ordo “Benedictines” at the “Monks in the West” Conference with Buddhists<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“- Religious Orders.  <strong>For religious orders in America, the end is in sight</strong>.  In 1965, 3,559 young men were studying to become Jesuit priests.  In 2000, the figure was 389.  With the Christian Brothers, the situation is even more dire.  Their number has shrunk by two-thirds, with the number of seminarians falling 99 percent.  In 1965, there were 912 seminarians in the Christian Brothers.  In 2000, there were only seven.  <strong>The number of young men studying to become Franciscan and Redemptorist priests fell from 3,379 in 1965 to 84 in 2000</strong>.” <a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[3]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s not a surprise that the religious orders in the Vatican II sect are almost dead.  Why would a Catholic young man or woman want to join when basically the only thing they stand for is the promotion of false religions and “human dignity”?</p>
<p>“Franciscans” in Massachusetts welcome gay “Catholics,” with no denunciation of the abominable homosexual lifestyle, thus encouraging them in their activity.<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4">[4]</a></p>
<p>Novus Ordo nuns worship with Buddhists in front of a Buddhist statue.<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5">[5]</a></p>
<p>The official website of the Irish “Jesuits” prominently states that there can be: “No service of faith without… <em>openness to other religious experiences</em>.”<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6">[6]</a>  This is from the General Congregation of Irish Jesuits – total apostasy.</p>
<p>The official website for the Novus Ordo “Order of St. Benedict” links to the Anglican and “Orthodox” Benedictines!<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7">[7]</a></p>
<p>The practice of Yoga is also rampant in Novus Ordo religious orders.  Since the wicked practice of Yoga is rampant in not only Novus Ordo religious orders but also secular institutions, such as the YMCA, we feel that it is important to quickly discuss what’s wrong with it.  Isn’t Yoga just stretching?  No.  We will quote a Novus Ordo “priest,” “Fr.” James Manjackal, who is very knowledgeable about the subject:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“What is Yoga?<strong>  The word Yoga means “union”, the goal of Yoga is to unite one’s transitory (temporary) self, “JIVA” with the infinite “BRAHMAN”, the Hindu concept of God</strong>.  <strong><u>This God is not a personal God, but it is an impersonal spiritual substance which is one with nature and cosmos</u></strong>.  <strong>Brahman is an impersonal divine substance that ‘pervades, envelopes and underlies everything.’</strong>  Yoga has its roots in the Hindu Upanishads, which is as old as 1,000 BC, and it tells about Yoga thus, ‘unite the light within you with the light of Brahman.’  ‘The absolute is within one self’ says the Chandogya Upanishads, ‘TAT TUAM ASI’ or ‘THOU ART THAT.’  The Divine dwells within each one of us through His microcosmic representative, the individual self called Jiva.  In the Bhagavad Gita, the lord Krishna describes the Jiva as ‘my own eternal portion,’ and ‘the joy of Yoga comes to yogi who is one with Brahman.’  In A.D. 150, the yogi Patanjali explained the eight ways that lead the Yoga practices from ignorance to enlightenment – the eight ways are like a staircase – They are self-control (yama), religious observance (niyama), postures (asana), breathing exercises (pranayama), sense control (pratyahara), concentration (dharana), deep contemplation (dhyana), enlightenment (samadhi).  <strong>It is interesting to note, here, that postures and breathing- exercises, often considered to be the whole of Yoga in the West, are steps 3 and 4 towards union with Brahman</strong>!  <strong>Yoga is not only an elaborate system of physical exercises, it is a spiritual discipline, purporting to lead the soul to samadhi, total union with the divine being</strong>.  Samadhi is the state in which the natural and the divine become one, man and God become one without any difference (Brad Scott: Exercise or religious practice? Yoga: What the teacher never taught you in that Hatha Yoga class” in <em>The Watchman Expositor</em>, Vol. 18, No. 2, 2001).”<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8">[8]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To summarize, <strong><u>Yoga is a spiritual discipline</u></strong> <strong>which attempts to unite one with <u>the divine within oneself and united with all of creation</u></strong> through breathing, physical exercises, concentration, etc.  The idea that the divine is to be found within oneself is, of course, occultic.  The idea that the divine permeates all of creation – the idea upon which the practice of Yoga is based and toward which it is geared – is Pantheism and condemned by Vatican I.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Pius IX, <em>First Vatican Council</em>, Session 3, Chap. 1, On God the Creator of all things: "<strong>The holy, Catholic, Apostolic, Roman Church believes and confesses that there is one, true, living God</strong>, Creator and Lord of heaven and earth... <strong>who</strong>, although He is one, singular, altogether simple and unchangeable spiritual substance, <strong>must be proclaimed distinct in reality and essence from the world</strong>..."<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9">[9]</a></p>
<p>Pope Pius XI, <em>Mit Brennender Sorge</em> (# 7), March 14, 1937:<br />"<strong>Whoever identifies, by pantheistic confusion, God and the universe</strong>, by either lowering God to the dimensions of the world, or raising the world to the dimensions of God, <strong>is not a believer in God</strong>."<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10">[10]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As an aside, John Paul II himself taught this condemned pantheistic notion in his encyclical <em>Dominum et Vivificantem</em> (50.3), May 18, 1986.  He stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"'The Word became flesh.'  <strong>The Incarnation of God the Son signifies the taking up into unity not only of human nature, but in this human nature, in a sense, of everything that is 'flesh': the whole of humanity, the entire visible and material world</strong>.  The Incarnation, then, also has a cosmic significance, a cosmic dimension."<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11">[11]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice that as he was expounding (as usual) his heretical belief that Christ is united to each and every man, in this case John Paul II decided to take it one step further: not only has Christ united Himself with every man (he says), but with the "entire visible and material world." According to Antipope John Paul II, the grass, trees, rivers, lakes, oceans, etc. were all united with Christ by virtue of the Incarnation.  He develops the thought in the next sentence of this encyclical.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>John Paul II,<em> Dominum et Vivificantem</em> (50.3), May 18, 1986:<br />The 'first-born of all creation,' becoming incarnate in the individual humanity of <strong>Christ, <u>unites himself</u> in some way with the entire reality of man, which is also 'flesh' - and in this reality with all 'flesh,' <u>with the whole of creation</u>."</strong> <a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12">[12]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What we had in Antipope John Paul II was a Pantheist.  In Pantheism, the world and God make a single thing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Catholic Dictionary, by Attwater: "<strong>Pantheism</strong> - A false philosophy which consists in confounding God with the world<em>. <strong>According to some the world is absorbed by God</strong></em> (Indian pantheists, Spinoza); others teach that God is absorbed by the world of which he is the force and the life... <strong>But all [Pantheists] seek to establish an identity of substance between God and the world</strong>."<a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13">[13]</a></p>
<p>The Catholic Encyclopedia:<br />"Pantheism, the view according to which God and the world are one."<a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14">[14]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since, as we saw above, the practice of Yoga is based on the idea of union with the divine within oneself and within all of creation, <u>the practice of Yoga is therefore an expression of belief in the condemned pantheistic heresy that God and His creation are a single thing.</u>  Practicing Yoga, therefore, is practicing a false religion and expressing belief in a false god.  The conservative Novus Ordo priest we quoted above, who is outraged by the rampant practice of Yoga in “Christian” and “Catholic” circles, summed the situation up quite well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<strong><u>The practice of Yoga is pagan at best, and occult at worst.  This is the religion of antichrist and for the first time in history it is being widely practiced throughout the Western world and America</u></strong>.  It is ridiculous that even yogi masters wearing a Cross or a Christian symbol deceive people saying that Yoga has nothing to do with Hinduism and say that it is only accepting the other cultures.  Some have masked Yoga with Christian gestures and call it “Christian Yoga.”  <strong>Here it is not a question of accepting the culture of other people, it is a question of accepting another religion</strong>...”<a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15">[15]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The Monastery of the Holy Spirit</strong> offers a special “Fundamentals of Yoga and Christianity” Retreat.<a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16">[16]</a>  <strong>The Carmelite Spiritual Center </strong>in Darien, Illinois offered a “Living Your Light” Yoga Retreat.<a href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17">[17]</a>  <strong>The “Catholic” Ecclesia Center</strong> in Girard, Pennsylvania – which is approved by the Diocese in which it resides<a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18">[18]</a> – includes on its staff <u>a Yoga instructor!</u></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Michael Plasha is a credentialed Yoga Therapist and a Yoga Alliance registered teacher… He has also trained in Zen and Vipassana meditation.  Since 1980 Michael has taught over 3,000 classes in yoga and meditation… Yoga … is a non-dogmatic approach to union with the Divine presence within everyone.”<a href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19">[19]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice that <strong>the Ecclesia Center</strong> admits that Yoga is an approach to the Divine presence “within everyone,” thus proving that it’s rooted in, and directed toward, Pantheism and the occult.  The website also states that Ecclesia Center “provides spiritual renewal to persons of <u>all faiths</u>.”<a href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20">[20]</a>  This is total apostasy, fully approved by the diocese.</p>
<p>Other examples could be given, but the evil practice of Yoga is so rampant at “Catholic” monasteries that Budget Travel Online actually advertises for it!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“More than 2,000 monasteries, abbeys, and spiritual retreat centers are scattered throughout the United States and Canada.  About 80 percent are linked to a religious order.  <strong>But most take a more ecumenical, interfaith approach to accommodate this increased interest</strong>.  ‘In the old days if you were a Catholic retreat center, you advertised yourself that way.  Now most of them want everybody to come,’ Stone says.  <strong><u>Many places offer yoga</u></strong>, Buddhist thought, prayers of all sorts.”<a href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21">[21]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Novus Ordo “Trappists” and “Jesuits” are officially installed in Novus Ordo Monasteries as teachers of Zen Buddhism!</strong></p>

<p>Monastic Interreligious Dialogue (Newsletter) - Sponsored by North American Benedictine and Cistercian monasteries of men and women</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“Fr. Kevin Hunt Installed as Zen Teacher- </strong>On April 17, 2004, <strong>Fr. Kevin Hunt, OCSO, a Trappist monk of </strong><a href="http://www.spencerabbey.org/"><strong>St. Joseph’s Abbey in Spencer, Massachusetts</strong></a><strong>, and a former member of the MID board, <u>was installed as a Zen teacher (Sensei) in a ceremony held at the abbey</u></strong>.  The installation was led by Fr. Robert Kennedy, S.J., who is the only North American Jesuit who is also a Zen Master (Roshi) and who served as Fr. Kevin’s teacher.<strong> The installation was witnessed by the abbot of St. Joseph’s and the rest of the monastic community as well as by over seventy guests</strong>,<strong> <u>including Zen teachers and members of Catholic religious orders from around the country</u>.</strong></p>
<p>     “Fr. Kevin thereby became the first Trappist monk who is also a Zen teacher.  <strong>In recognition of this unique event, letters of commendation were written by His Holiness the Dalai Lama</strong> <strong>and <u>by Fr. Peter-Hans Kolvenbach, the superior general of the Society of Jesus</u></strong>.  Fr. Kolvenbach wrote, ‘Many Christians have found Zen to be a valuable instrument for progressing in the spiritual life.  By coming to focus on the present moment through the practice of the techniques of Zen meditation, the Christian can become aware of God’s immediate loving presence.’</p>
<p>     “Fr. Kolvenbach’s remarks reflect the commitment made by the Jesuits at their 34th General Congregation to foster dialogue with other religions…  <strong>Noting that Pope John Paul II has wished to make interreligious dialogue an apostolic priority for the third millennium</strong>, <strong>Fr. Kennedy said that his work with Fr. Kevin was one way in which this priority could be carried out…”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Seventh Annual Vaishnava-Christian Dialogue<br />“</strong>On April 16-17, 2004, three persons directly connected with the North American MID were among the sixteen who participated in <strong>the seventh annual Vaishnava-Christian Dialogue</strong>, held at Rockwood Manor Park in Potomac, Maryland, <strong>under the co-sponsorship of the Office of Ecumenical and Interreligious Affairs of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops</strong> and the International Society of Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON)…</p>
<p>     “As in most past years, the first day of the program included addresses by a Christian and a Vaishnava participant, each commenting on texts from the two traditions… [The] opening talks elicited lively dialogue among the other participants for the rest of the day and <strong>on into the next day, which began with the singing of hymns and chanting of prayers from the two traditions</strong>.”<a href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23">[23]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So now we have ceremonies going on in the Novus Ordo Monasteries to induct men as teachers of the occultic practice of Zen Buddhism.  But once again, all of this happens because they’re just following Vatican II and the lead of the New Church in Rome. </p>
<p>Please note that “Fr.” Peter-Hans Kolvenbach, <strong>the alleged Superior General of the Society of Jesus</strong>, wrote a letter of commendation for this event.  This is the leader of the entire “Jesuit” Order in the Vatican II sect. </p>
<p>Note that the newsletter (quoted above), which is sponsored by “North American Benedictine and Cistercian” monasteries, referred to the satanic Dalai Lama (who claims to be a god) as “His Holiness.”  Note that <strong>John Paul II’s program of interreligious dialogue is used as the justification for this event.</strong> </p>
<p>Finally, please note that the United States “Conference of Catholic Bishops” sponsored the <strong>seventh annual Vaishnava-Christian Dialogue in which took place the chanting of Hindu prayers!  </strong>Behold the members, the religious, and the leaders of your Church, if you believe that the Vatican II sect is the Catholic Church.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Cloistered Nuns on Mt. Carmel pray for Jews to remain Jews</strong></p>
<p>An article was posted online about cloistered Novus Ordo nuns who spend most of their day in silence and want Jews to remain Jews:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“While Pope John Paul II pleads for religious harmony in the Holy Land, 17 <strong>cloistered nuns on Mount Carmel quietly pray for their Jewish neighbors.  Not to win souls for Christendom.  <u>These nuns want Jews to be Jewish</u></strong>…</p>
<p><strong>“‘How can you be a servant in Israel if you speak about conversion</strong>?’ says Sister Angela del Bono, mother superior of the Monastery of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, in a rare interview from behind a metal grille in the parlor of a sprawling granite convent.  She pounds her hand on her forehead beneath a veil.  ’Imagine someone coming in here and telling me to become an Adventist or a Muslim,’ she says, smiling at her own fervor…</p>
<p>”’<strong><u>We pray that Jews remain true to their covenant</u></strong>,’ says Sister Angela del Bono, 68, holding a thick wool sweater tightly around her floor-length brown habit in the unheated convent.</p>
<p>“We pray that people come to the full revelation of God... If they are good Jews and we are good Christians this is already glory to God without forcing anyone to change,’ the native Italian nun says, speaking in English.  ’We pray for all to be happy and be righteous in front of God.<strong>  <u>Each man can go to Heaven--Jews, Catholics, Muslims,   Zulus--if they are... of goodwill</u></strong>.  If they feel godly, <strong>if they follow their own conscience, they will go to Heaven</strong>.”<a href="#_edn24" name="_ednref24">[24]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>People really need to consider how bad this is.  This shows us again that the Vatican II sect is the sect of Antichrist.  The belief that one can freely reject Jesus Christ – the doctrine of Antichrist – has been imbibed by the religious orders which are supposedly dedicated to Jesus Christ.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 John 2:22 – “Who is a liar, but <strong><u>he who denieth that Jesus is the Christ?  He is antichrist</u></strong>, who denieth the Father, and the Son.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This also reminds us that people can spend much time in supposedly religious acts for God, and it will profit them nothing if they don’t have the true Faith.  These nuns spend much of their day in silence and their convent is unheated; yet they are complete apostates, rejecters of God and headed for Hell.  This shows us that without the true faith it is impossible to please God, no matter how many other religious and devotional acts one thinks he performs.  Notice that the nun also expressed precisely the heresy condemned by Pope Gregory XVI, that Heaven is open to the naturally “good” members of any religion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Gregory XVI, <em>Mirari Vos</em> (# 13), Aug. 15, 1832:  “With the admonition of the apostle, that ‘there is one God, one faith, one baptism’ (Eph. 4:5), <strong>may those fear who contrive the notion that the safe harbor of salvation is open to persons of any religion whatever.</strong>  They should consider the testimony of Christ Himself that ‘those who are not with Christ are against Him,’ (Lk. 11:23) and that they disperse unhappily <u>who do not gather with Him.</u> <strong> Therefore, ‘without a doubt, they will perish forever, unless they hold the Catholic faith whole and inviolate’</strong> <strong>(Athanasian Creed)</strong>.”<a href="#_edn25" name="_ednref25">[25]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040605001557/http://www.spiritualityhealth.com/newsh/items/blank/item_3495.html"><strong>The Apostasy of the Novus Ordo “Benedictine” Nuns; need one say more? </strong></a></p>
<p>We’ve already cited the fact that the Novus Ordo “Benedictines” actually link to the Anglicans and Eastern “Orthodox.”  Mary Lou Kownacki, “OSB,” is executive director of Alliance of International Monasticism, <u>which links 200 Novus Ordo “Benedictine” and “Cistercian” communities</u> in the developing world with those in the United States.  She is also director of development and communications for the Novus Ordo “Benedictine” sisters of Erie, PA.  In line with the Vatican II religion, she exemplifies total interreligious apostasy.  In her poem quoted below, she invokes the “Cosmic Christ,” whom she says spoke through the apostate Teilhard de Chardin.  She also says he spoke through the idolater Mahatma Gandhi, the heretic Martin Luther King, Jr., and the Jews Anne Frank and Rabbi Heschel. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“O Cosmic Christ… Through Teilhard de Chardin, scientist of the cosmos, you imagined a new heaven and a new earth.  Through Mahatma Gandhi, great soul, you became nonviolent in the struggle for justice… Through Anne Frank… you preserved goodness in the midst of a great evil… Through Martin Luther King, Jr.… Through Rabbi Abraham Heschel, Hasidic sage, you answered our search for meaning.”<a href="#_edn26" name="_ednref26">[26]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What more does one really have to say?  This <u>apostate directs</u> an <strong>alliance which links 200 Novus Ordo “Benedictine” and “Cistercian” communities</strong>.  And to think that people ask us why we are not in communion with the Novus Ordo “Benedictines.”  Those who accept people such as this as Catholics are not in communion with the Catholic Church.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Saint John’s</strong><strong> Abbey: a typical example of outrageous apostasy in the Vatican II sect’s religious orders</strong></p>
<p>Saint John’s Abbey, located in Collegeville, Minnesota, is one of the major and historic monasteries of the Vatican II sect in America.  The “Benedictines” at St. John’s Abbey, like the Vatican II sect to which they belong, are unfortunately not even remotely Catholic.  As we introduced at the beginning of this section, in 2004 St. John’s Abbey held a “Monks in the West” meeting with Buddhist “monks.” </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Their magazine states: “<strong>We devoted two full days to sharing our personal spiritual journeys… <u>attending the Buddhist community’s chanting services</u>, </strong>meditating together and enjoying superb Chinese vegetarian cuisine.”<a href="#_edn27" name="_ednref27">[27]</a> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is complete and utter apostasy.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-125485 aligncenter" src="https://vaticancatholic.com/images/buddhist-prayer-ceremonies-monks-in-the-west.jpg" alt="" width="70%" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Novus Ordo “Benedictines” attended Buddhist prayer services at “Monks in the West” Conference. <a href="#_edn28" name="_ednref28">[28]</a>  Notice that their “cross” is neither a crucifix nor a cross, but a plus sign.</p>

<p>The same magazine states: “… <strong>Christianity can also learn from wisdom of the Buddhist tradition, especially in the area of thought and fantasy</strong>.  For example, in one session a monk from Shasta Buddhist Abbey… <strong>described the Buddhist method of accepting sexual feelings without either acting on them or repressing them</strong>, but just letting them pass through... We explored the possibility of publishing a book on what we learned about the meaning and practice of celibacy in our two traditions.”<a href="#_edn29" name="_ednref29">[29]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, the members of St. John’s Abbey not only meditated with pagans and idolaters and also attended their idolatrous services, but allowed them to promote their evil philosophy of not rejecting impure thoughts.  The Catholic Church, based on the teaching of Jesus Christ (Matthew 5:28), has always taught that impure thoughts and desires must be rejected.  What we’ve covered here is a profound example of apostasy in the Vatican II sect, but it’s quite typical.</p>
<p>A member of our religious community, prior to becoming a traditional Catholic, spent time at a Novus Ordo Monastery in South Carolina.  During his stay at the monastery, he attended a talk by a Novus Ordo “priest” who appeared to be a theologian.  The “priest” told the brothers that all religions lead to Heaven, and that there is no necessity to be Catholic to be saved.  The Novus Ordo monks who were present appeared to have no reaction, outrage or even surprise at these blatantly heretical teachings of the “priest.”  The young man, however, was so bewildered and stunned that he stayed up much of the night writing down scripture verses on the necessity of accepting Jesus Christ for salvation in order to refute the apostasy of the “priest.”  The next day he presented the information to the Novus Ordo monks in order to refute what had been said; they didn’t seem to care at all.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>An article by a “Benedictine” Nun, Sr. Mary Margaret Funk, further confirms the utter apostasy of the Vatican II sect’s religious orders   </strong></p>
<p>Many argue that the teachings of Vatican II don’t contradict Catholic dogma in any way.  They strenuously assert that the Vatican II religion is in perfect continuity with the unchanging Catholic religion.  Some people call these individuals (who defend everything in Vatican II and the post-conciliar apostasy) neo-Catholics; we call them neo-apostates, since they attempt to explain away everything from kissing the Koran to allowing idol-worshippers to take over and pray to false gods at Assisi.  <strong>But one of the most interesting and clear ways of proving that the Vatican II sect is not the Catholic Church is simply by looking at what its members believe at the local level</strong>.  We’ve done a great deal of this already, but the stories from individuals who have actually been discouraged from becoming Catholic by members of the Novus Ordo Church, including bishops, Vatican officials and RCIA teachers, seem almost endless.  So, if you ever want to be stirred to a holy indignation against the Vatican II apostasy, or if you ever want proof of what an abominable outrage the Vatican II sect is, or if you ever want to be convinced that it <u>is a matter of Heaven or Hell to completely reject this false, non-Catholic sect falsely posing as the Catholic Church</u>, then just call some Novus Ordo churches and ask them: “<em>Do you accept the dogma Outside the Church There is No Salvation?  Is Islam a false religion?  Is Judaism a false religion?</em>” </p>
<p>The responses that you will get will astound you, if you know and possess the true Catholic Faith.  The responses you will get will confirm for you, if you are sincere, that the religion of these individuals (the Vatican II religion) is not the Catholic religion.  <strong>It will confirm for you, if you are sincere, that the entire Vatican II sect is apostate, since these individuals are simply putting into practice what is taught and exemplified by Vatican II concerning non-Christian religions</strong>. </p>
<p>In that vein, one of us was paging through the <em>St. Anthony Messenger</em> and came across an article entitled <strong><em>Islam: What Every Catholic Should Know</em> by Mary Margaret Funk</strong>, “O.S.B.”  (<em>St. Anthony Messenger</em> is one of the most prominent publications of the Vatican II sect.)  So here was an article by a supposed Benedictine Nun on Islam.  What did she say?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mary Margaret Funk, “O.S.B.,” <em>Islam: What Catholics Should Know</em>, p. 36, St. Anthony Messenger, August, 2005: “Unlike Christians, who believe that Jesus was the Son of God and an indivisible part of God, <strong>Muslims believe that the Holy Prophet Mohammed (570-632) </strong>was a man and that he followed Adam, Abraham, Moses, David, Solomon, and Jesus as the last of the great prophets to receive divine revelation.”<a href="#_edn30" name="_ednref30">[30]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While referring to Mohammed as “the Holy Prophet,” Mary Margaret didn’t think it necessary to mention to her “Catholic” readership that Mohammed was a false prophet and the originator of a false religion.  She continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mary Margaret Funk, “O.S.B.,” <em>Islam: What Catholics Should Know</em>, St. Anthony Messenger, August, 2005, p. 36: “<strong><u>Mohammed tested the authenticity of his revelations with prayer and fasting</u></strong>.  It was two years before he went public with <strong>his profound religious experience</strong>.”<a href="#_edn31" name="_ednref31">[31]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The impression that any reasonable reader of this article gets is that Mary Margaret holds that Mohammed’s false revelations were authentic or could be authentic (which is apostasy).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mary Margaret Funk, “O.S.B.,” <em>Islam: What Catholics Should Know</em>, St. Anthony Messenger, August, 2005, p. 38: “I am struck by the absolute grasp of and reverence for the Quran communicated by the Muslims.  The name <em>Allah</em>, after all, is simply the Arabic word for God, <strong><u>the one God of Judaism, Christianity and Islam</u></strong>.”<a href="#_edn32" name="_ednref32">[32]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here we see that Mary Margaret bases her effusive praise for the false religion of Islam on the false teaching of Vatican II that Jews, Christians and Muslims supposedly worship the same God.  We see this very clearly illustrated in the next quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mary Margaret Funk, “O.S.B.,” <em>Islam: What Catholics Should Know</em>, St. Anthony Messenger, August, 2005, p. 39: “<strong><u>When I was present for the Muslim <em>salat</em>, I felt as though I was at home with my nuns in Beech Grove, Indiana</u>.  It was the same God, the same praise and the same bended knee</strong>.”<a href="#_edn33" name="_ednref33">[33]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is pure religious indifferentism.  But it is all based precisely on the teaching of Vatican II on Muslims: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Vatican II document, Nostra aetate</em> (# 3): “The Church also looks upon <u>Muslims</u> with respect.  They worship the one God living and subsistent, merciful and mighty, creator of heaven and earth, who has spoken to humanity and to whose decrees, even the hidden ones, they<u> seek to submit themselves whole-heartedly</u>, just as Abraham, to whom the Islamic faith readily relates itself, submitted <u>to God</u>… <u>Hence they have regard for the moral life and worship God in prayer, almsgiving and fasting</u>.”<a href="#_edn34" name="_ednref34">[34]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mary Margaret Funk continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mary Margaret Funk, “O.S.B.,” <em>Islam: What Catholics Should Know</em>, St. Anthony Messenger, August, 2005, p. 39: “<strong>My community of 82 nuns carries me when my devotion is tepid and my inclination is capricious.  I see that same zeal among my Muslim friends.  The stopping for prayer is the norm allowing us to be God-conscious during the in-between times and to help God-consciousness become pervasive.  What then happens is that we return to ritual prayer thankful for this felt presence of God</strong>.”<a href="#_edn35" name="_ednref35">[35]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously, Mary Margaret Funk considers the false religion of Islam – which is considered to be an abomination by the Catholic Church – as a perfectly valid way of worshipping and “pleasing” God.  Mary Margaret Funk is a member of Our Lady of Grace Monastery in Beech Grove, Indiana.  She is not a member of the Catholic Church.  She is a Christ-rejecter and an apostate who believes in salvation outside the Church and that false religions are not false.  She is the former prioress of her large religious community, and <strong><u>she is the executive director of Monastic Interreligious Dialogue</u></strong>.  She is simply following the teaching of Vatican II and post-conciliar ecumenism; she is typical of the hierarchy and the religious of the Vatican II sect.</p>
<p>How many stories such as this could be duplicated?  <strong>They could be duplicated without end, in every diocese under Benedict XVI, and in every single religious community in communion with him</strong>.  Have Mary Margaret Funk and millions of others misunderstood the teaching of Vatican II?  No, she has understood perfectly that Vatican II teaches that Muslims worship God truly in prayer, almsgiving and fasting.  Have Mary Margaret Funk and millions of others misunderstood the meaning of John Paul II’s attending of the mosque, the Assisi event, the Buddhist temple, the Lutheran church and the synagogue?  No, they have understood quite well that such actions are a validation of those false religions.  It is because they have followed the official teaching of Vatican II that they have come to apostasy as a result.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Apostasy of Mother Teresa and her Religious Order, The Missionaries of Charity </strong></p>
<p>Mother Teresa of Calcutta was the founder of the Missionaries of Charity, one of the largest and most famous religious orders in the Vatican II sect.  <strong>Mother Teresa is considered to be one of the shining lights of the post-Vatican II religion</strong>.  The sad truth is that she wasn’t even Catholic.  Her religious indifferentism and apostasy from the Catholic Faith was illustrated in a 1989 interview with <em>Time </em>Magazine.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Mother Teresa’s 1989 Interview with <em>Time Magazine</em> – She loved all religions!</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“Time:</strong> What do you think of Hinduism?</p>
<p><strong>Mother Teresa:</strong> <strong><u>I love all religions</u></strong>, but I am in love with my own.  No discussion.  That's what we have to prove to them.  Seeing what I do, they realize that I am in love with Jesus.”<a href="#_edn36" name="_ednref36">[36]</a> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>As quoted here, Mother Teresa loved all religions.  Mother Teresa loved religions of Satan!  She loved religions of idolatry, religions that reject Christ, etc.  This is apostasy.  And she will soon be a “saint” in the Vatican II sect, thus proving again that the Vatican II sect is not the Catholic Church.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 Corinthians 13:3- “<strong>And if I should distribute all my goods to feed the poor</strong>, and if I should deliver my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mother Teresa’s charity was false, because it was not founded on the true Faith.  It profited her nothing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Pius XI, <em>Mortalium Animos</em> (# 9), Jan. 6, 1928: “For which reason, since <u>charity is based on a complete and sincere faith</u>, the disciples of Christ must be united principally by the bond of one faith.”[37]</p>
<p>Hebrews 11:6: “But without faith it is impossible to please God…”</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-125495 aligncenter" src="https://vaticancatholic.com/images/mother-teresa-buddha.jpg" alt="" width="70%" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Here is a picture of Mother Teresa worshipping Buddha in 1975.</p>
<p>In the picture on the left, we see Mother Teresa worshipping Buddha in a ceremony of thanksgiving for the 25th anniversary of the Missionaries of Charity.  She is kneeling in prayer in the bottom-left corner of the picture.  The picture on the right is a close-up of the same ceremony, which took place on October 7, 1975.  When we consider this act, together with Mother Teresa’s many other statements of apostasy below, there is no doubt that she was among the worst apostates and biggest false prophets in all of Catholic history.</p>
<p>After John Paul II held his idolatrous inter-religious prayer meeting in Assisi in 1986 where, among other abominations, the Dalai Lama placed a Buddhist statue on top of the Tabernacle, Mother Teresa referred to the day as “the most beautiful gift of God.”<a href="#_edn38" name="_ednref38">[38]</a></p>
<p>A recently released book,<em> Everything Starts From Prayer, Mother Teresa’s Meditations on Spiritual Life for People of all Faiths</em>, also shows Mother Teresa’s thorough rejection of the Catholic Faith and the necessity of Christ for salvation.  The foreword quotes one of her most famous statements, which reveals the demonic spirit of Mother Teresa’s work:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mother Teresa: “I’ve always said <strong><u>we should help</u></strong><u> <strong>a Hindu become a better Hindu</strong>, <strong>a Muslim become a better Muslim</strong></u>, a Catholic become a better Catholic.”<a href="#_edn39" name="_ednref39">[39]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is apostasy from Jesus Christ and the Catholic Faith.  Mother Teresa also stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>Some call Him Ishwar, some call Him Allah, some simply God</strong>, but we have to acknowledge that it is He who made us for greater things: to love and be loved.  What matters is that we love.  We cannot love without prayer, and so <strong>whatever religion we are, we must pray together</strong>.”<a href="#_edn40" name="_ednref40">[40]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>So, in short, Mother Teresa believed that God (the Most Holy Trinity) and demons (the false gods of the heathens) are one and the same</strong>.  The fact that she is considered “saintly” by the Vatican II sect constitutes one of the biggest spiritual frauds in Christian history.  Mother Teresa expressed a general attitude of indifference to what religion a man professed, and manifested her approval of false religions of the Devil (non-Christian religions) consistently.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Once, <strong>when Mother Teresa was ministering to a dying Buddhist man, a visitor overheard her whisper, ‘You say a prayer in your religion,</strong> and I will say a prayer as I know it.  Together we will say this prayer and it will be something beautiful for God.’”<a href="#_edn41" name="_ednref41">[41]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In <em>Mother Teresa, A Pictorial Biography</em> by Joanna Hurley, we read the following on page 68 about Mother Teresa’s Order, <em>The Missionaries of Charity</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A Catholic Order, <em>The Missionaries of Charity</em> is nonetheless ecumenical in its work.  <strong><u>The nuns bury the dying they have nursed according to the rites of each individual’s religion</u></strong>, <strong>and they observe local holidays [of the other religions]</strong> along with those of the Church.  <strong>Here a group of young nuns help children light sparklers for Diwali, India’s Festival of Lights</strong>.”<a href="#_edn42" name="_ednref42">[42]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means that the nuns of Mother Teresa’s order not only approved of, but actually <u>participated in,</u> the pagan rites of non-Christian religions.  <strong>This is because they are following the religious indifferentism of their founder, Mother Teresa.</strong>  On page 68 of this book, there is a picture of <strong>the nuns of Mother Teresa’s order lighting the sparklers for the Hindu festival of Diwali</strong> with gigantic smiles on their faces.  This is sin against the Faith of the worst kind; nay, it is religion of Antichrist – where man, and his personal preference for false religions, supersedes and replaces Jesus Christ. </p>
<p>A friend of ours from Canada recently called the superior of one of Mother Teresa’s convents.   Our friend said, “How come Mother Teresa never tried to convert anyone?”  “Mother Superior” from Canada responded: “<em>It is the ultimate respect for the human person to respect his religion</em>.”  “Mother Superior” told our friend that these non-Catholics are going to Heaven even if they reject Christ, as long as they are “good people,” for that’s what matters, according to her.  In other words, man and his choice of religion are greater and more important than Jesus Christ.  This is the Gospel of Antichrist, and Mother Teresa was its main false prophet and exemplar outside of the Vatican II antipopes.  She cloaked her apostasy in purely natural works which gave her the appearance of true charity when, in fact, she had none.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope St. Pius X, <em>Editae Saepe</em> (# 28), May 26, 1910: “As a matter of fact, however, <strong><u>merely naturally good works are only a counterfeit of virtue</u> since they are neither permanent nor sufficient for salvation</strong>.”<a href="#_edn43" name="_ednref43">[43]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mother Teresa fed and clothed the bodies of many people, but she left their souls starving for what they needed most, Our Lord Jesus Christ.  She deprived these souls of the only thing that really mattered, and therefore was not their true friend, but their enemy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Luke 12:4-5: “[Jesus saith] And I say to you, <u>my friends</u>: <strong>Be not afraid of them who kill the body</strong>, and after that have no more that they can do.  But I will shew you whom you shall fear: fear ye him, who after he hath killed, hath power to cast into hell.  Yea, I say to you, fear him.”</p>
<p>John 17:3- “Now <strong>this is life everlasting, that they may know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ</strong>, whom thou hast sent.”</p>
<p>1 John 5:11-12: “And this is the testimony, that God hath given to us eternal life.  <strong>And this life is in his Son.  He that hath the Son, hath life.  He that hath not the Son, hath not life</strong>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have spent some extended time on this issue because it’s likely that the Vatican II sect will soon “canonize” the apostate Mother Teresa, who exemplified some of the worst religious indifferentism of any of the members of the Vatican II sect.  Since canonizations are infallible, this will be further proof that the Vatican II antipopes are not true popes.</p>
<p>We could continue with page after page of examples of the apostasy of the religious orders, but the point should be clear.  The religious orders of the Vatican II sect are apostate since they are following the teaching of Vatican II.</p>
