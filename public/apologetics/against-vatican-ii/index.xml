      <description>By Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: endtimes.video&#xA;There are many heresies in Vatican II. This article will focus on one that’s very widespread and quite visible in the Vatican II Sect. (The video linked above contains abundant visual evidence for these points). As our material proves, the Vatican II Sect is not the Catholic Church but the prophesied end-times Counter Church. In number 8 of Vatican II’s decree on ecumenism, we read:</description>

      <title>The New Rite of Consecration of Bishops</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/apologetics/against-vatican-ii/new-rite-consecration-bishops/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/apologetics/against-vatican-ii/new-rite-consecration-bishops/</guid>
      <description>By Brother Michael Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;Paul VI also changed the rite for consecrating bishops. This is very significant because groups such as the Fraternity of St. Peter and the Institute of Christ the King (indult groups who offer the traditional Latin Mass) ordain their men in the Traditional Rite of Ordination, but have the ordinations done by “bishops” who were made “bishops” in the New Rite of Episcopal Consecration.</description>

      <description>By Brother Michael Dimond and Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;Michael Davies: “… every prayer in the traditional rite [of Ordination] which stated specifically the essential role of a priest as a man ordained to offer propitiatory sacrifice for the living and dead has been removed [from the New Rite of Paul VI]. In most cases these were the precise prayers removed by the Protestant reformers, or if not precisely the same there are clear parallels.</description>
