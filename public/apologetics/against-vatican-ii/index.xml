      <description>Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;Pope Leo XIII, Dall’Alto (# 2), Oct. 15, 1890: “It is needless now to put the Masonic sects upon their trial. They are already judged; their ends, their means, their doctrines, and their action, are all known with indisputable certainty. Possessed by the spirit of Satan, whose instrument they are, they burn like him with a deadly and implacable hatred of Jesus Christ and of His work; and they endeavor by every means to overthrow and fetter it.</description>

      <description>Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;To understand what God might allow to transpire in the final days, we must understand Catholic teaching on the Papacy and look at some examples in Church history of things that God has allowed to occur with regard to the Papacy.&amp;nbsp; It’s a fact of history, Scripture and tradition that Our Lord Jesus Christ founded His universal Church (the Catholic Church) upon St. Peter.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&#xA;Matthew 16:18-19-“And I say to thee: That thou are Peter: and upon this rock I will build my Church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.</description>

      <description>Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;Fr. Mario Luigi Ciappi, papal theologian to Pope Pius XII: “In the Third Secret [of Fatima] it is foretold, among other things, that the great apostasy in the Church will begin at the top.”[1]&#xA;The message and miracle of Our Lady of Fatima in 1917 is one of the greatest events in the history of the Catholic Church. Since the miracle at Fatima, which occurred on Oct. 13, 1917, was predicted to take place in advance, and was fulfilled in the presence of almost 100,000 people, it’s probably the greatest miracle in Catholic history outside the Resurrection.</description>

      <description>Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;Pope Leo XIII’s Prayer to St. Michael the Archangel is prophetic.&amp;nbsp; Composed over 100 years ago, and then suppressed, Pope Leo XIII’s original Prayer to St. Michael is one of the most interesting and controversial prayers relating to the present situation in which the true Catholic Church finds itself.&amp;nbsp; On September 25, 1888, following his morning Mass, Pope Leo XIII became traumatized to the point that he collapsed.&amp;nbsp; Those in attendance thought that he was dead.</description>

      <description>By Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: endtimes.video&#xA;There are many heresies in Vatican II. This article will focus on one that’s very widespread and quite visible in the Vatican II Sect. (The video linked above contains abundant visual evidence for these points). As our material proves, the Vatican II Sect is not the Catholic Church but the prophesied end-times Counter Church. In number 8 of Vatican II’s decree on ecumenism, we read:</description>

      <description>Brother Michael Dimond and Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;John Paul II during a syncretist prayer gathering with various false religious leaders at Assisi in 1986 - This “ecumenical” activity was always condemned by the Catholic Church, and specifically labeled as a complete rejection of the Catholic Faith by Pope Pius XI in 1928. This is a revolution against the Faith – a new Gospel.&#xA;Luke 18:8- “But yet the Son of man, when he cometh, shall he find, think you, faith on earth?</description>

      <title>The New Rite of Consecration of Bishops</title>
      <link>https://eens-en.netlify.app/apologetics/against-vatican-ii/new-rite-consecration-bishops/</link>

      <description>By Brother Michael Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;Paul VI also changed the rite for consecrating bishops. This is very significant because groups such as the Fraternity of St. Peter and the Institute of Christ the King (indult groups who offer the traditional Latin Mass) ordain their men in the Traditional Rite of Ordination, but have the ordinations done by “bishops” who were made “bishops” in the New Rite of Episcopal Consecration.</description>

      <description>By Brother Michael Dimond and Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;Michael Davies: “… every prayer in the traditional rite [of Ordination] which stated specifically the essential role of a priest as a man ordained to offer propitiatory sacrifice for the living and dead has been removed [from the New Rite of Paul VI]. In most cases these were the precise prayers removed by the Protestant reformers, or if not precisely the same there are clear parallels.</description>
