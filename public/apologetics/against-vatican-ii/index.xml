      <description>Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;The Bishop of Buffalo getting vested by the Dalai Lama in a massive interreligious service of apostasy[1] (more on this below)&#xA;St. Robert Bellarmine, De Romano Pontifice, lib. II, cap. 30: “Finally, the Holy Fathers teach unanimously not only that heretics are outside of the Church, but also that they are ‘ipso facto’ deprived of all ecclesiastical jurisdiction and dignity.”&#xA;It’s important to emphasize once again the teaching of the Catholic Church that bishops who become heretics immediately lose all authority and any offices they might possess.</description>
