<p>Benedict XVI praying like Muslims toward Mecca in a mosque, with arms crossed in the Muslim prayer gesture called “the gesture of tranquility,” on Nov. 30, 2006</p>
<p>Benedict XVI is Joseph Ratzinger.  Joseph Ratzinger was one of the most radical theologians at Vatican II, where his ideas were influential in guiding the revolutionary course of the council.</p>
<p>At Vatican II, Ratzinger hung around with notorious heretics such as Karl Rahner.  And even though he was a priest, Joseph Ratzinger showed up at Vatican II not in clerical garb, but in a suit and tie.</p>
<p>Ratzinger was named a  “cardinal” by Paul VI in 1977, and became Prefect for the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith five years later.</p>
<p>During these years, Ratzinger wrote a staggering number of books.  The heresies from Ratzinger that will be covered here come from having read many of his speeches and 24 books written by him.</p>
<p>Many Catholics are familiar with the fact that in the year 2000 the Vatican allegedly revealed the Third Secret of Fatima.  Most traditionalists immediately recognized that the so-called “Third Secret” which the Vatican released was not the real Third Secret of Fatima, but rather that a massive fraud had been perpetrated on the world.  The primary author of the document which attempted to convince the world of this fraud against Our Lady’s message at Fatima was Joseph Ratzinger, Benedict XVI.</p>
<p>The document on the so-called “Third Secret,” entitled <em>The Message of Fatima</em>, was authored by Ratzinger and “Cardinal” Bertone.  It was an attempt to “debunk” the Message of Fatima, as the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> was forced to admit.  In the document, Ratzinger referred to only one Fatima scholar, Fr. Edouard Dhanis.  Fr. Dhanis held that large portions of the Message of Fatima were fabrications of Lucy.  By referring to Dhanis as his Fatima “expert,” Ratzinger showed that he also holds that the Message of Fatima is a fabrication.</p>
<p>This reveals one of the primary characteristics of Ratzinger.  He is a deceiver.  He will give the appearance of devotion to something (e.g. Fatima), while trying to rip apart its meaning.  He will give the appearance of conservatism, while inculcating the most abominable heresies.  We will now cover the astounding heresies of Joseph Ratzinger, Benedict XVI.</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong>BENEDICT XVI’S HERESIES ON THE JEWS</strong></h2>
<p>Based on Scripture and Tradition, the Catholic Church teaches infallibly that it is necessary for salvation to believe in Jesus Christ and the Catholic Faith.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>John 8:23-24-“… for if you believe not that I am He, you shall die in your sin.”</p>
<p>Pope Eugene IV, <em>Council of Florence</em>, 1439, <em>ex cathedra</em>: “Whoever wishes to be saved, needs above all to hold the Catholic faith… it is necessary for eternal salvation that he faithfully believe also in the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ... the Son of God is God and man...”<a id="_ednref2" title="" href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Catholic Church also teaches infallibly that the Old Covenant ceased with the coming of Christ, and was replaced with the New Covenant.  The Council of Florence taught that those who practice the Old Law and the Jewish religion are sinning mortally and are “<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">alien to the Christian faith and not in the least fit to participate in eternal salvation</span></strong>, unless someday they recover from these errors.”<a id="_ednref3" title="" href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>In 2001, however, the Pontifical Biblical Commission released a book entitled <strong><em>The Jewish People and Their Sacred Scriptures in the Christian Bible</em>.</strong>  This book rejects the dogma that the Old Covenant has ceased.  <strong>It teaches that the Old Covenant is still valid, and that the Jews’ wait for the Coming of the Messiah (which was part of the Old Covenant) is also still valid.  It teaches that Jesus doesn’t have to be seen as the prophesied Messiah; it is possible to see Him, as the Jews do, as not the Messiah and not the Son of God. </strong></p>
<p>In section II, A, 5, <em>The Jewish People and their Sacred Scriptures in the Christian Bible</em> states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">“<strong>Jewish messianic expectation is not in vain</strong>...”</span><a id="_ednref4" title="" href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4">[4]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In section II, A, 7, <em>The Jewish People and their Sacred Scriptures in the Christian Bible</em> states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“…to read the Bible as Judaism does necessarily involves <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">an implicit acceptance of all its presuppositions</span>, </strong>that is, the full acceptance of what Judaism is, in particular, the authority of its writings and rabbinic traditions, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">which exclude faith in Jesus as Messiah and Son of God</span>… Christians can and ought to admit that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the Jewish reading of the Bible is a possible one</span></strong>…”<a id="_ednref5" title="" href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5">[5]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, according to this Vatican book, Christians can and ought to admit that the Jewish position that Jesus is not the Son of God and the prophesied Messiah is a possible one!  <strong>The preface for this totally heretical book was written by none other than Joseph Ratzinger, the now Benedict XVI</strong>.</p>
<p>This is antichrist!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 John 2:22 – “... he who denieth that Jesus is the Christ?  He is antichrist…”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Heresy is a rejection of a dogma of the Catholic Faith; apostasy is a rejection of the entire Christian Faith.  This book contains both heresy and apostasy, fully endorsed by Benedict XVI.</p>
<h3 align="center"><strong>Benedict XVI teaches that Jesus doesn’t have to be seen as the Messiah</strong></h3>
<p>Benedict XVI teaches the same denial of Jesus Christ in a number of his books:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Benedict XVI, <em>God and the World</em>, 2000, p. 209: “<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">It is of course possible to read the Old Testament so that it is not directed toward Christ; it does not point quite unequivocally to Christ</span>.  And if Jews cannot see the promises as being fulfilled in him, this is not just ill will on their part, but genuinely because of the obscurity of the texts…  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">There are perfectly good reasons, then, for denying that the Old Testament refers to Christ and for saying, No, that is not what he said</span>.  And there are also good reasons for referring it to him – that is what the dispute between Jews and Christians is about.</strong>”</span><a id="_ednref6" title="" href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6">[6]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI says that there are perfectly good reasons for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> believing that the Old Testament refers to Christ as the prophesied Messiah.  He says that the Old Testament doesn’t point unequivocally to Our Lord as the Messiah.  This is another total denial of the Christian Faith.</p>
<p>What makes this apostasy all the more outrageous is the fact that the New Testament is filled with passages which declare that Our Lord is the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy.  To quote just <em>one passage of many</em>, in John 5 Our Lord specifically tells the Jews that what is written in the Old Testament concerning Him will convict them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>John 5:39, 45-47 – “<strong>Search the scriptures, for you think in them to have life everlasting; and the same are they that give testimony of</strong> <strong>me</strong>… <strong>the one who will accuse you is Moses</strong>, in whom you have placed your hope.  For if you had believed Moses, you would have believed me, <strong>because he wrote about me</strong>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But, according to Benedict XVI, all of these Biblical declarations that Our Lord is the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, including Our Lord’s own words, may be false.  According to Benedict XVI, the Jewish reading that Our Lord is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> the Messiah, not the Son of God, and not foretold in the Old Testament, is possible and valid.  This is totally heretical, apostate and antichrist.</p>
<p>Benedict XVI also denies Jesus Christ in his book <em>Milestones</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>Milestones</em>, 1998, pages 53-54: “I have ever more come to the realization that <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Judaism</span>… <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and the Christian faith</span></strong> described in the New Testament are two ways of appropriating Israel’s Scriptures, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">two ways that, in the end, are both determined by the position one assumes with regard to the figure of Jesus of Nazareth</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Scripture we today call Old Testament is in itself open to both ways</span></strong>…”<a id="_ednref7" title="" href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7">[7]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI again declares that Scripture is open to holding the Jewish view of Jesus, that Jesus is not the Son of God.  This is precisely why Benedict XVI repeatedly teaches the heresy that Jews don’t need to believe in Christ for salvation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>Zenit News story</em>, Sept. 5, 2000: “[W]e are in agreement that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a Jew</span>, and this is true for believers of other religions, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">does not need to know or acknowledge Christ as the Son of God in order to be saved</span>…”<a id="_ednref8" title="" href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8">[8]</a></p>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>God and the World</em>, 2000, pages 150-151: “…<strong>their [the Jews] No to Christ brings the Israelites</strong> into conflict with the subsequent acts of God, but at the same time we know that they are assured of the faithfulness of God.  <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">They are not excluded from salvation</span></strong>…”<a id="_ednref9" title="" href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9">[9]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a total rejection of Catholic dogma.</p>
<h3 align="center"><strong>Benedict XVI’s Public Act of Apostasy at the German Synagogue</strong></h3>
<p>All of this is why on August 19, 2005 – a Friday at noon, the same day and hour that Jesus was crucified – Benedict XVI arrived at the Jewish Synagogue in Cologne, Germany and took active part in a Jewish worship service.  To take active part in non-Catholic worship is a sin against the divine law and the First Commandment, as was always taught before Vatican II.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">St. Ambrose, <em>Sermon 37</em>, <em>The Two Ships</em>: “<strong>The faithlessness of the Synagogue is an insult to the Savior</strong>.  Therefore He chose the bark of Peter, and deserted that of Moses; that is, <strong>He rejected the faithless Synagogue, and adopts the believing Church</strong></span>.”<a id="_ednref10" title="" href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10">[10]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://www.mostholyfamilymonastery.com/Cover_pictures/BenedictXVIinsynagogue.jpg" alt="Anti Pope Benedict XVI apostasy at the German Synagogue" width="716" height="531" /></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><em>Benedict XVI in the synagogue of the Jews, taking active part in Jewish worship on Aug. 19, 2005<a id="_ednref11" title="" href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11">[11]</a></em></h4>
<p>In taking part in a Jewish worship service, Benedict XVI committed a public act of apostasy.  At the synagogue, Benedict XVI was seated prominently near the front.  The synagogue was packed with Jews who were there to see him.  Benedict XVI was not only an integral part of the Jewish worship service, he was its main feature.  This is without any doubt <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">active participation</span></em> in the Jewish religion.</p>
<p>Very close to Benedict XVI, the cantor of the synagogue prayed and sang Jewish prayers <em>at the top of his lungs</em>.  Benedict made gestures, such as bowing his head and clapping his hands, to show his approval and participation in the Jewish service.  He joined the Jews in the <em>Kaddish prayer</em>, and Yiddish music blared in the background.</p>
<p>When Benedict XVI rose to speak (and eventually to pray) in the synagogue, the entire synagogue rose to its feet and applauded him – applauded him for his acceptance of their religion.  <strong>Everyone on earth who saw this event knows that it had one meaning: Benedict XVI has no problem with Jews who reject Jesus Christ, and (according to him) they have no obligation to accept Jesus Christ to be saved</strong>.</p>
<p>Benedict XVI teaches that Jews can be saved, that the Old Covenant is valid, and that Jesus Christ is not necessarily the Messiah.  He is a bold heretic against the Gospel and the Catholic Faith.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Eugene IV, Council of Florence, “Cantate Domino,” 1441, <em>ex cathedra</em>: “The Holy Roman Church firmly believes, professes and preaches that <strong>all those who are outside the Catholic Church</strong>, not only pagans <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">but also Jews</span></strong> or heretics and schismatics, <strong>cannot share in eternal life and will go into the everlasting fire</strong> which was prepared for the devil and his angels, unless they are joined to the Church before the end of their lives…”<a id="_ednref12" title="" href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12">[12]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 align="center"><strong>Benedict XVI encourages the Chief Rabbi of Rome in his “mission”</strong></h3>
<p align="center"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://www.mostholyfamilymonastery.com/Benedict_XV_with_Jews/B16_withrabbis_castel.jpg" alt="Anti Pope Benedict XVI encourages the Chief Rabbi of Rome in his “mission”" width="500" height="313" /></p>
<p>Benedict XVI exchanges a gift with rabbis at Castelgandolfo, Sept. 15, 2005<a id="_ednref13" title="" href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13">[13]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>Address to Chief Rabbi of Rome</em>, Jan. 16, 2006: “<strong>Distinguished Chief Rabbi, you were recently entrusted with the spiritual guidance of Rome’s Jewish Community</strong>; you have taken on this responsibility enriched by your experience as a scholar and a doctor who has shared in the joys and sufferings of a great many people.<strong>  I offer you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">my heartfelt good wishes for your mission</span></strong>, and I assure you of my own and my collaborators’ cordial <strong>esteem</strong> and friendship.”<a id="_ednref14" title="" href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14">[14]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is apostasy.  Benedict XVI encourages the Chief Rabbi in his “mission”!   He also expresses his esteem for the Rabbi and his Christ-rejecting apostolate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>General Audience</em>, Jan. 17, 2007: “<strong>For almost 20 years now the Italian Bishops’ Conference has dedicated <span style="text-decoration: underline;">this Judaism Day to furthering knowledge and esteem for it</span></strong> and for developing the relationship of reciprocal friendship between the Christian and Jewish communities, a relationship that has developed positively since the Second Vatican Council and <strong>the historic visit of the Servant of God John Paul II to the Major Synagogue in Rome</strong>…. <strong>Today I invite you all to address an ardent prayer to the Lord that Jews and Christians may</strong> respect and <strong>esteem one another</strong>…”<a id="_ednref15" title="" href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15">[15]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He speaks positively of a day dedicated to Judaism.  This day, according to Benedict XVI, is to further esteem for Judaism (a false religion which rejects Christ).  This is an utter rejection of the Catholic Faith and Jesus Christ.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>BENEDICT XVI TEACHES THAT PROTESTANTS AND SCHISMATICS DON’T NEED TO BE CONVERTED</strong></h2>
<p>Heretics and schismatics, such as Protestants and the Eastern Orthodox, are outside the Catholic Church and must be converted to the Catholic Faith for unity and salvation.  It’s necessary for them to accept all the Catholic dogmas and councils, including the dogmatic definitions at Vatican I in 1870.  This is infallible Catholic teaching.</p>
<p>However, Benedict XVI teaches that Protestants and Eastern Schismatics don’t need to be converted, and don’t need to accept Vatican Council I.  We are providing extra context for this quotation, despite its length, since it’s such a significant heresy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>Principles of Catholic Theology,</em> 1982, pp. 197-198: “Against this background we can now weigh the possibilities that are open to Christian ecumenism.  The maximum demands on which the search for unity must certainly founder are immediately clear.  <strong>On the part of the West, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the maximum demand would be that the East recognize the primacy of the bishop of Rome in the full scope of the definition of 1870</span></strong> and in so doing submit in practice, to a primacy such as has been accepted by the Uniate churches.<strong>  </strong>On the part of the East, the maximum demand would be that the West declare the 1870 doctrine of primacy erroneous and in so doing submit, in practice, to a primacy such as has been accepted with the removal of the Filioque from the Creed and including the Marian dogmas of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.  <strong>As regards Protestantism, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the maximum demand of the Catholic Church would be that the Protestant ecclesiological ministers be regarded as totally invalid and that Protestants be converted to Catholicism</span></strong>; the maximum demand of Protestants, on the other hand, would be that the Catholic Church accept, along with the unconditional acknowledgement of all Protestant ministries, the Protestant concept of ministry and their understanding of the Church and thus, in practice, renounce the apostolic and sacramental structure of the Church, which would mean, in practice, the conversion of Catholics to Protestantism and their acceptance of a multiplicity of distinct community structures as the historical form of the Church.  <strong>While the first three maximum demands are today rather unanimously rejected by Christian consciousness</strong>, the fourth exercises a kind of fascination for it – as it were, a certain conclusiveness that makes it appear to be the real solution to the problem.  This is all the more true since there is joined to it the expectation that a Parliament of Churches, a ‘truly ecumenical council’, could then harmonize this pluralism and promote a Christian unity of action.  That no real union would result from this, but that its very impossibility would become a single common dogma, should convince anyone who examines the suggestion closely that such a way would not bring Church unity but only a final renunciation of it.  As a result, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">none of the maximum solutions offers any real hope of unity</span></strong>.” <a id="_ednref16" title="" href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16">[16]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice that Benedict XVI specifically mentions, <strong>and then bluntly rejects</strong>, the traditional teaching of the Catholic Church that the Protestants and Eastern Schismatics must be converted to the Catholic Faith.  He says that their conversion and acceptance of Vatican I and the Papacy is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span> the way for unity.  This is a total rejection of the Catholic Faith.</p>
<p>He repeats the same heresy on the next page of his book, where he says that non-Catholics are not required to accept the Papal Primacy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>Principles of Catholic Theology</em> (1982), p. 198: “<strong>Nor is it possible, on the other hand, for him to regard as the only possible form and, consequently, as binding on all Christians the form this primacy has taken in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries</strong>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The symbolic gestures of Pope Paul VI and, in particular, his kneeling before the representative of the Ecumenical Patriarch [the schismatic Patriarch Athenagoras] were an attempt to express precisely this</span>…”<a id="_ednref17" title="" href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17">[17]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI is referring to the Papal Primacy here, and he says that all Christians are not bound to believe in the Papal Primacy as defined by Vatican I in 1870!  This means that Benedict XVI claims to be a Catholic and the pope while he holds that heretics and schismatics are not bound to believe in the Papacy!  This is one of the greatest frauds in human history.  Further, <strong>notice that Benedict XVI even admits that Paul VI’s ecumenical gestures with the schismatics were meant to show precisely that the schismatics don’t have to accept the Papal Primacy</strong>.  This is a blatant denial of Vatican Council I.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Pius IX, <em>Vatican Council I</em>, ex cathedra: "… <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all the faithful of Christ must believe that the Apostolic See and the Roman Pontiff hold primacy over the whole world</span>… <span style="text-decoration: underline;">This is the doctrine of Catholic truth from which no one can deviate</span> and keep his faith and salvation."<a id="_ednref18" title="" href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18">[18]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Church itself was founded by Our Lord upon the Papal Primacy, as the Gospel declares (Matthew 16:18-20) and as Catholic dogma defines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Boniface VIII, <em>Unam Sanctam</em>, Nov. 18, 1302, <em>ex cathedra</em>: “…we declare, we proclaim, we define that it is absolutely necessary for salvation that every human creature be subject to the Roman Pontiff..”<a id="_ednref19" title="" href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19">[19]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>People need to seriously meditate on how bad this is that Benedict XVI holds that all Christians are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> required to accept the primacy of the popes.  It alone proves that he is a manifest heretic.  But it gets even worse…</p>
<h3 align="center"><strong>Benedict XVI not only denies the dogma that non-Catholics need to believe in the Papacy, but questions whether popes have supreme jurisdiction in the Church at all!</strong></h3>
<p>For long sections of his book, <em>Principles of Catholic Theology</em>, Benedict XVI engages in detailed discussions of issues dealing with the Eastern “Orthodox” (the schismatics), as well as Luther, the Protestants, etc.  These discussions are fascinating for our purposes, since they constitute a veritable position paper of Benedict XVI on these topics.  In his discussion concerning the “Orthodox,” one discovers that Benedict XVI doesn’t even believe in the dogma of the Papacy.  <strong>It is important to remember that the Eastern Schismatics (the so-called “Orthodox”) often readily admit that the popes are the successors of St. Peter as Bishops of Rome.  Many of the “Orthodox” also say that the pope, as the Bishop of Rome, is “the first among equals” with a “primacy of honor”</strong>; but they deny – and in this consists their chief heresy and schism – that the popes have a primacy of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">supreme jurisdiction</span> from Christ to rule the entire Church.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Pius XI, <em>Mortalium Animos</em> (# 7), Jan. 6, 1928, speaking of heretics and schismatics: <strong>“Among them there indeed are some, though few, who grant to the Roman Pontiff a primacy of honor</strong> or even a certain jurisdiction or power, but this, however, they consider not to arise from the divine law but from the consent of the faithful.”<a id="_ednref20" title="" href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20">[20]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI discusses the position of these schismatics, which rejects the primacy of supreme jurisdiction of the popes, and here’s what he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>Principles of Catholic Theology</em> (1982), pp. 216-217: “Patriarch Athenagoras [the non-Catholic, schismatic Patriarch] spoke even more strongly when he greeted the Pope [Paul VI] in Phanar: ‘Against all expectation, <strong>the bishop of Rome is among us, the first among us in honor, ‘</strong>he who presides in love’<strong>.’  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">It is clear that, in saying this, the Patriarch [the non-Catholic, schismatic Patriarch] did not abandon the claims of the Eastern Churches or acknowledge the primacy of the west</span></strong>.  Rather, he stated plainly what the East understood as the order, the rank and title, of the equal bishops in the Church – <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">and it would be worth our while to consider whether this archaic confession, which has nothing to do with the ‘primacy of jurisdiction’ but confesses a primacy of ‘honor’ and agape, might not be recognized as a formula that adequately reflects the position that Rome occupies in the Church</span></strong> – ‘holy courage’ requires that prudence be combined with ‘audacity’: ‘The kingdom of God suffers violence.’”<a id="_ednref21" title="" href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21">[21]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above is an astounding and explicit denial of the dogma of the Papacy and the infallible canon below!  Benedict XVI announces the position of the schismatic patriarch, which acknowledges no primacy of supreme jurisdiction of the popes, and he not only tells us that the position of the schismatic is acceptable (as we saw already), but that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the schismatic position may in fact be the true position</span> on the Bishop of Rome!  In other words, the Papacy (the supreme jurisdiction of the popes over the universal Church by the institution of Christ as successors of St. Peter) may not exist at all!  This is an astounding, incredible and huge heresy!</p>
<p>The fact that this man now claims <em>to be</em> the pope when he doesn’t even believe in the Papacy is surely one of the greatest frauds in human history.  Those who obstinately hold that this non-Catholic is the pope assist in perpetuating that monumental fraud.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Pius IX, <em>Vatican Council I</em>, Sess. 4, Chap. 3, Canon, <em>ex cathedra</em>: “If anyone thus speaks, that the Roman Pontiff has only the office of inspection or direction, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">but not the full and supreme power of jurisdiction over the universal Church</span>, not only in things which pertain to faith and morals, but also in those which pertain to the discipline and government of the Church spread over the whole world; or, that he possesses only the more important parts, but not the whole plenitude of this supreme power… let him be anathema.”<a id="_ednref22" title="" href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22">[22]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 align="center"><strong>Benedict XVI also denies that the Papacy was even held in the first millennium and tells us that this is why we cannot bind the schismatics to believe in it!</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>Principles of Catholic Theology</em> (1982), pp. 198-199: “… <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In other words, Rome must not require more from the East with respect to the doctrine of the primacy than had been formulated and was lived in the first millennium</span></strong>.  <strong>When the Patriarch Athenagoras</strong> [the non-Catholic, schismatic Patriarch], on July 25, 1967, on the occasion of the Pope’s visit to Phanar, <strong>designated him as the successor of St. Peter, as the most esteemed among us, as one who presides in charity, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">this great Church leader was expressing the ecclesial content of the doctrine of the primacy as it was known in the first millennium</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rome</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> need not ask for more</span></strong>.”<a id="_ednref23" title="" href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23">[23]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is another astounding major heresy against the Papacy and Vatican I.  Benedict XVI again says that the schismatic position of the non-Catholic Patriarch Athenagoras, which rejects the Papacy and merely acknowledges the Bishop of Rome as the successor of St. Peter with a primacy of honor <span style="text-decoration: underline;">BUT NOT OF SUPREME JURISDICTION</span>, is sufficient.  Further, Benedict XVI says that the reason we cannot expect the “Orthodox” to believe in the Papacy (the primacy of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">supreme jurisdiction of the popes</span>, not just a primacy of honor) <strong>is because it wasn’t even held in the first millennium (according to him)!</strong>  Therefore, Benedict XVI holds that the primacy of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">supreme jurisdiction</span> conferred by Jesus Christ upon St. Peter and his successors is just a fiction, an invention of later ages, not held in the early Church.  <strong>He says that the schismatic position of Athenagoras – holding that the successor of St. Peter possesses a mere primacy of honor – is “the doctrine of the primacy as it was known in the first millennium” </strong>and that “Rome need not ask for more”!  Notice how directly Benedict XVI denies Vatican I, which defined that <em>in all ages</em> the primacy of jurisdiction was recognized:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Pius IX, <em>Vatican Council I</em>, Sess. 4, Chap. 2, <em>ex cathedra</em>: “<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Surely no one has doubt, rather all ages have known</span></strong> <strong>that the holy and most blessed Peter</strong>, chief and head of the apostles and pillar of faith and foundation of the Catholic Church, <strong>received the keys of the kingdom from our Lord Jesus Christ</strong>, the Savior and Redeemer of the human race; <strong>and he up to this time and always lives and presides and exercises judgment in his successors</strong>, the bishops of the holy See of Rome, which was founded by him and consecrated by his blood.  <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Therefore, whoever succeeds Peter in this chair, he according to the institution of Christ Himself, holds the primacy of Peter over the whole Church</span></strong>.”<a id="_ednref24" title="" href="#_edn24" name="_ednref24">[24]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ratzinger (now Benedict XVI) totally rejects this dogma and the entire Catholic Faith.</p>
<p>Moving back to Benedict XVI’s heretical teaching that non-Catholics are not <em>bound</em> to believe in the Papacy, this has also been taught by Benedict XVI’s Prefect for Promoting Christian Unity, “Cardinal” Walter Kasper.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Cardinal” Walter Kasper: “… <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">today we no longer understand ecumenism in the sense of a return, by which the others would ‘be converted’ and return to being Catholics</span>.  This was expressly abandoned by Vatican II</strong>.”<a id="_ednref25" title="" href="#_edn25" name="_ednref25">[25]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kasper’s statement is so heretical that even many of the defenders of Benedict XVI have labeled Kasper a heretic.  But as we’ve seen, Benedict XVI believes the exact same thing.  In the following quote, we see that Benedict XVI uses basically the exact same words as Kasper in rejecting Catholic dogma!</p>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>Address to Protestants at World Youth Da</em>y, August 19, 2005: “And we now ask: What does it mean to restore the unity of all Christians?... <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">this unity does not mean what could be called ecumenism of the return</span>: that is, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to deny and to reject one’s own faith history</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Absolutely not</span>!”</strong><a id="_ednref26" title="" href="#_edn26" name="_ednref26"></a></p>

</div>
<p>As this comparison shows clearly, just like the notorious heretic “Cardinal” Kasper, Benedict XVI blatantly rejects the “ecumenism of the return,” that is, that non-Catholics need to return to the Catholic Church by conversion and reject their heretical sects.  They both reject the teaching of Pope Pius XI word for word.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Pius XI, <em>Mortalium Animos</em> (# 10), Jan. 6, 1928: “… the union of Christians can only be promoted by promoting the <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">return</span></em> to the one true Church of Christ of those who are separated from it…”<a id="_ednref29" title="" href="#_edn29" name="_ednref29">[29]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI is formally heretical.  He holds that Protestants and Eastern Schismatics don’t need to be converted and accept Vatican I.  He is a blatant rejecter of the necessity of the Catholic Faith for salvation, and the dogmatic teaching of Vatican I.</p>
<h3 align="center"><strong>That is why Benedict XVI joins Paul VI and John Paul II in praising the overturning of the excommunications against the “Orthodox” – and therefore in denying Vatican I</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>Ecumenical Message to Schismatic Patriarch of Constantinople</em>, Nov. 26, 2005: “This year we commemorate the 40th Anniversary of 7 December 1965, that day on which Pope Paul VI and Patriarch Athenagoras,<strong> dissatisfied with what had occurred in 1054, decided together at Rome and Constantinople ‘to cancel from the Church’s memory the sentence of excommunication which had been pronounced.’</strong>”<a id="_ednref30" title="" href="#_edn30" name="_ednref30">[30]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the year 1054, the Patriarch of Constantinople, Michael Cerularius, broke communion with the Catholic Church and the pope of Rome.  Cerularius rejected the supreme authority of the pope and closed Roman Rite churches in Constantinople.  Cerularius was excommunicated by Pope St. Leo IX, and the Great Schism of the East was formalized.<a id="_ednref31" title="" href="#_edn31" name="_ednref31">[31]</a></p>
<p><strong>Thus, what “occurred in 1054,” mentioned by Benedict XVI above, refers to the excommunications leveled by the Catholic Church against those who followed Michael Cerularius into schism and into a rejection of the Papacy</strong>.  Paul VI “lifted” these excommunications at the end of Vatican II, and John Paul II praised and commemorated the lifting of them many times.  Now we see that Benedict XVI follows John Paul II’s example and also commemorates the event.</p>
<p>All of this simply means that Paul VI, John Paul II and now Benedict XVI have attempted to overturn <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the Papacy as a dogma</span> which must be believed <span style="text-decoration: underline;">under pain of heresy and excommunication</span>.  But as we saw already, Vatican I declared many times and in many ways that those who reject the dogma of the Papacy are anathematized, cut off from the Faith.  Hence, to attempt to overturn the excommunications against those who still reject the Papacy is simply to boldly reject the teaching of Vatican I.  It’s formal heresy and schism signified in word and deed.</p>
<h3 align="center"><strong>Benedict XVI prays ecumenical Vespers with schismatics and Protestants and says he loves the schismatic Orthodox Church</strong></h3>
<p align="center">Benedict XVI praying ecumenical Vespers on Sept. 12, 2006.<a id="_ednref32" title="" href="#_edn32" name="_ednref32">[32]</a>  This is active participation in non-Catholic worship.  It is a manifestation of heresy by deed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>Address during ecumenical Vespers service</em>, Sept. 12, 2006: “Dear Brothers and Sisters in Christ!  We are gathered, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Orthodox Christians, Catholics and Protestants – and together with us there are also some Jewish friends</span> – to sing together the evening praise of God… This is an hour of gratitude for the fact that <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">we can pray together in this way</span></strong> and, by turning to the Lord, at the same time grow in unity among ourselves… Among those gathered for this evening’s Vespers, I would like first to greet warmly the representatives of the Orthodox Church.  I have always considered it a special gift of God’s Providence that, as a professor at Bonn, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I was able to come to know and to love the Orthodox Church</span></strong>, personally as it were, through two young Archimandrites, Stylianos Harkianakis and Damaskinos Papandreou, both of whom later became Metropolitans… <strong>Our koinonia [communion] is above all communion with the Father</strong> and with his Son Jesus Christ in the Holy Spirit; it is communion with the triune God, made possible by the Lord through his incarnation and the outpouring of the Spirit.  This communion with God creates in turn koinonia among people, as a participation in the faith of the Apostles…”<a id="_ednref33" title="" href="#_edn33" name="_ednref33">[33]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is another major heresy of Benedict XVI.  First, he takes active part in the prayer and worship of non-Catholics, which is condemned in Catholic teaching.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Pius XI, <em>Mortalium Animos</em> (# 10): “So, Venerable Brethren, it is clear why <strong>this Apostolic See has never allowed its subjects to take part in the assemblies of non-Catholics</strong>…”<a id="_ednref34" title="" href="#_edn34" name="_ednref34">[34]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Second, <strong>he says that he loves the Orthodox Church</strong> – a schismatic and heretical non-Catholic sect.  What can be more heretical than saying: “I love the schismatic Church”?  He then indicates that he, the schismatics, and the Protestants have a communion with God, communion with each other, and communion with the Faith of the Apostles.  This is all totally heretical.  Benedict XVI is a public heretic in communion with non-Catholics.</p>
<h3 align="center"><strong>Benedict XVI’s worst heresy?  He prays with the leader of the world’s “Orthodox” schismatics and signs a Joint Declaration with him telling him he’s in the Church of Christ</strong></h3>

<p>Benedict XVI embracing the leader of the world’s Eastern “Orthodox” schismatics, Bartholomew I, in his Nov. 2006 visit to Turkey</p>
<blockquote>
<p>BBC News, Nov. 29, 2006 –“Benedict XVI has met Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I in Turkey, on the second day of a landmark visit to the largely Muslim country.<strong>  </strong>The Istanbul talks with the spiritual leader of the world's Orthodox Christians aimed to heal an old rift.  <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The two leaders began their meeting by holding a joint prayer service at the St George [Orthodox] Church in Istanbul</span></strong>.”<a id="_ednref35" title="" href="#_edn35" name="_ednref35">[35]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>During his 2006 trip to Turkey, Benedict XVI went into two schismatic cathedrals and met with three schismatic patriarchs, including the leader of the world’s schismatics: Eastern Orthodox Patriarch of Constantinople, Bartholomew I.  Benedict XVI not only committed a forbidden act of communication in sacred things with the schismatic, but he may have committed his worst heresy in his joint declaration with him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>Joint Declaration with Schismatic Patriarch Bartholomew</em>, Nov. 30, 2006: “This fraternal encounter which brings us together, Pope Benedict XVI of Rome and Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I, is God's work, and in a certain sense his gift.  We give thanks to the Author of all that is good, who allows us once again, in prayer and in dialogue, to express the joy we feel as brothers and to renew our commitment to move towards full communion. This commitment comes from the Lord's will and <span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">from our responsibility as Pastors in the Church of Christ</span></strong></span>… As far as relations between the Church of Rome and the Church of Constantinople are concerned, we cannot fail to recall the solemn ecclesial act effacing the memory of the ancient anathemas which for centuries had a negative effect on our Churches.”<a id="_ednref36" title="" href="#_edn36" name="_ednref36">[36]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Did you get that?  He says: “… <em>our responsibility as pastors IN THE CHURCH OF CHRIST</em>”!  What could be more heretical than: declaring<strong> in a joint declaration with the leader of the world’s schismatics that the schismatic leader, who rejects the Papacy and Papal Infallibility, is “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">in the Church of Christ</span>”?</strong></p>
<p>Benedict XVI made this formally heretical declaration <em>in a schismatic cathedral </em>as part of a joint declaration<em> during a divine liturgy with a notorious schismatic</em>!  Thus, it’s official: Benedict XVI has declared in a public joint declaration that one can reject the Papacy, Papal Infallibility, Vatican I, etc. and be <strong>in the Church of Christ</strong>.  He is without any doubt a public heretic.  Anyone who denies this, in light of these facts, is also a heretic.  Even the most dishonest and hardened defender of Antipope Benedict XVI will find it impossible to explain this one away.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Leo XIII, <em>Satis Cognitum</em> (#15), June 29, 1896 – <strong>Bishops Separated from Peter and his Successors Lose All Jurisdiction</strong>: “From this it must be clearly understood that <strong>Bishops are deprived of the right and power of ruling, if they deliberately secede from Peter and his successors</strong>; because, by this secession, they are separated from the foundation on which the whole edifice must rest.  <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">They are therefore outside the edifice itself</span></strong>; <strong>and for this very reason they are separated from the fold</strong>, whose leader is the Chief Pastor; they are exiled from that Kingdom, the keys of which were given by Christ to Peter alone… <strong>No one, therefore, unless in communion with Peter can share in his authority, since it is absurd to imagine that he who is outside can command in the Church</strong>.”<a id="_ednref37" title="" href="#_edn37" name="_ednref37">[37]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>All of this heresy from Benedict XVI <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is also a total mockery of the saints and martyrs</span> who suffered because they refused to become Eastern “Orthodox,” as was covered earlier in the section entitled: <strong>Catholics who were tortured and martyred because they refused to become Eastern Schismatics. </strong></p>
<h3 align="center"><strong>That is why Benedict XVI even encourages the Schismatic Patriarch to Resume His Ministry</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>Address</em>, Nov. 12, 2005: “In this regard, <strong>I ask you, venerable Brothers, to convey my cordial greeting to Patriarch Maxim, First Hierarch of the Orthodox Church of Bulgaria</strong>.  <strong>Please express to him my best wishes for his health <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and for the happy resumption of his ministry</span></strong>.”<a id="_ednref38" title="" href="#_edn38" name="_ednref38">[38]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI encourages the non-Catholic, schismatic patriarch to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">resume</span> his non-Catholic and schismatic ministry.  Further, on his trip to Turkey, Benedict XVI recalled John Paul II’s gesture of giving relics to the schismatics.<strong>  </strong>Benedict XVI said that such an action is a sign of communion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>Speech to schismatic patriarch Bartholomew,</em> Nov. 29, 2006: “… St. Gregory of Nazianzus and St. John Chrysostom… <strong>Their relics rest in basilica of St. Peter in the Vatican, and a part of them were given to your Holiness as a sign of communion</strong> by the late Pope John Paul II for veneration in this very cathedral.”<a id="_ednref39" title="" href="#_edn39" name="_ednref39">[39]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This proves again that the “gestures of ecumenism” signify a rejection of the dogma that schismatics must accept the Papal Primacy to be in communion with the Church.</p>
<h3 align="center"><strong>Benedict XVI’s incredible heresy on the schismatic “Archbishop” of Athens </strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>Address,</em> Oct. 30, 2006: “<strong>I am also pleased to address my thoughts and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">good wishes to His Beatitude Christodoulos, Archbishop of Athens and All Greece</span></strong>: <strong>I ask the Lord to sustain his farsightedness and prudence in carrying <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the demanding service that the Lord has entrusted to his care</span>.</strong>  <strong>Through him I wish to greet with deep affection the holy synod of the Orthodox Church of Greece and the faithful whom it serves lovingly and with apostolic dedication</strong>.”<a id="_ednref40" title="" href="#_edn40" name="_ednref40">[40]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI says that Christodoulos, the schismatic, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">non-Catholic</span> “Orthodox” bishop in Greece, has authority over all of Greece!  He also indicates that the schismatics are the “faithful” and that the Lord entrusted the schismatic bishop with a “demanding service.”  Further, notice the amazing headline which appeared in the official Vatican newspaper when this non-Catholic bishop came to visit Benedict XVI.  The official Vatican newspaper (quoting Benedict XVI) referred to this non-Catholic schismatic “archbishop” in Greece as the "Archbishop of Athens and All Greece" in huge headlines which were repeated throughout its newspaper.  All of this is an utter rejection of Catholic dogmatic teaching on the unity of the Church.</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong>MORE HERESIES WITH THE PROTESTANTS FROM BENEDICT XVI</strong></h2>
<p>Benedict XVI explicitly rejects converting Protestants again in his book <em>Principles of Catholic Theology</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>Principles of Catholic Theology</em> (1982), p. 202: “<strong>It means that the Catholic does not insist on the dissolution of the Protestant confessions</strong> and the demolishing of their churches <strong>but hopes, rather, that they will be strengthened in their confessions and in their ecclesial reality</strong>.”<a id="_ednref41" title="" href="#_edn41" name="_ednref41">[41]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice that Benedict XVI doesn’t want the Protestant religions dissolved and converted to Catholicism, but hopes, rather, that they will be strengthened in their confession of Protestantism.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>Address at Ecumenical Meeting in Lutheran church in Warsaw</em>, May 25, 2006: “Together with you I give thanks <strong>for the gift of this encounter of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">common prayer</span></strong>… our ecumenical aspirations must be steeped in prayer, in <strong>mutual forgiveness</strong>… The words of the Apocalypse remind us that we are all on a journey towards the definitive encounter with Christ, when he will reveal before our eyes the meaning of human history… <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">As a community of disciples</span></strong>, we are directed towards that encounter, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">filled with hope and trust that it will be for us the day of salvation</span></strong>, the day when our longings will be fulfilled, thanks to our readiness to let ourselves be guided by the mutual charity which his Spirit calls forth within us… Allow me to recall once more the ecumenical encounter that took place in this church with the participation of your great compatriot John Paul II…<br />“Since that encounter [with John Paul II in the Lutheran church], much has changed.  God has granted us to take many steps towards mutual understanding and rapprochement.  Allow me to recall to your attention some ecumenical events which have taken place in the world during that time: the publication of <strong>the Encyclical Letter <em>Ut Unum Sint</em></strong>… <strong>the signing at Augsburg of the ‘Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification’</strong>; the meeting on the occasion of the Great Jubilee of the Year 2000 and <strong>the ecumenical memorial of 20th-century witnesses of the faith</strong> [Protestant martyrs]; the resumption of Catholic-Orthodox dialogue on the world level… <strong>the publication of the ecumenical translation of the New Testament</strong> and the Book of Psalms… We note much progress in the field of ecumenism and yet we always await something more.”<a id="_ednref42" title="" href="#_edn42" name="_ednref42">[42]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s quite a bit of heresy in this speech that Benedict XVI gave <em>in</em> the Lutheran church.  Allow us to quickly summarize the main points.  First, Benedict XVI goes to the Lutheran temple and takes active part in a “common prayer” service (his words) with Lutherans, other Protestants and “Orthodox” schismatics.  This is a manifestation of heresy by deed – attendance at a non-Catholic Lutheran temple.</p>
<p>Second, he mentions the Second Coming of Christ, and says: “<em>we [i.e., he and the Lutherans and “Orthodox”] are directed towards that encounter, filled with hope and trust <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">that it will be for us the day of salvation</span></strong></em>”; in other words, the Protestants and schismatics to whom he was speaking will have salvation.  This is complete heresy.</p>
<p>Third, he describes himself and the Lutherans and “Orthodox” as a single community of disciples: “<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">As a community of disciples</span></strong>…”  This shows that Benedict XVI is part of the same Church as the Lutherans and the schismatics; that is, he is part of a non-Catholic sect.</p>
<p>Fourth, Benedict XVI recalls many false ecumenical achievements, including the totally heretical, Council-of-Trent-trashing <em>Joint Declaration with the Lutherans on Justification</em>.  He also recalled the “<strong>ecumenical memorial of 20th-century witnesses of the faith,” </strong>which was the commemoration of non-Catholics as martyrs for the Faith.<strong>  </strong>He also recalled <em>Ut Unum Sint</em>, which is filled with heresies, including the idea that there are non-Catholic saints.  He also <strong>promotes a new ecumenical translation of the Bible.  </strong>Benedict XVI is a manifestly heretical non-Catholic antipope.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Benedict XVI encourages the invalid head of the Anglican Church in his “ministry” and says the Anglican Sect is grounded in Apostolic Tradition</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>Address to Anglican “Archbishop of Canterbury</em>,” Nov. 23, 2006: “<strong>It is our fervent hope that the Anglican Communion</strong> <strong>will remain grounded in the Gospels and the Apostolic Tradition</strong> which form our common patrimony… The world needs our witness… May the Lord continue to bless you and your family, and <strong>may he strengthen you in your ministry to the Anglican Communion!”</strong><a id="_ednref43" title="" href="#_edn43" name="_ednref43">[43]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Anglican Sect is grounded, not in Apostolic Tradition, but in the “tradition” of Henry VIII’s adultery and schismatic break from the Catholic Church.  Benedict XVI encourages the schismatic and heretical head of the Anglican Sect in his “ministry,” and mocks all the saints and martyrs who suffered and died as martyrs because they wouldn’t become Anglicans.</p>
<h3 align="center"><strong>AT VATICAN II, BENEDICT XVI ALSO DENIED THAT NON-CATHOLICS SHOULD BE CONVERTED</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>Theological Highlights of Vatican II</em>, 1966, pages 61, 68: “… <strong>Meantime <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the Catholic Church has no right to absorb other Churches</span></strong>.  … <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A basic unity – of Churches that remain Churches, yet become one Church – must replace the idea of conversion</span></strong>…”<a id="_ednref44" title="" href="#_edn44" name="_ednref44">[44]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI is not even remotely Catholic.</p>
<h3 align="center"><strong>BENEDICT XVI PRAISES THE “GREATNESS” OF LUTHER’S “SPIRITUAL FERVOR”</strong></h3>
<p>Martin Luther was one of the worst heretics in Church history.  Luther attacked the Catholic Church and its dogmas with ferocity.  While never denouncing Luther as a heretic, Benedict XVI often speaks positively of Luther’s views and even praises him.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nationalcatholicreporter.org/word/word081205.htm#protestant" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">At Vatican II, Benedict XVI even complained<em> that the document Gaudium et Spes</em> relied too much on Teilhard de Chardin and not enough on Martin Luther</a>.<a id="_ednref45" title="" href="#_edn45" name="_ednref45">[45]</a>  Benedict XVI is also credited with saving the 1999 <em>Joint Declaration with the Lutherans on Justification</em>, which declared that Luther’s heresy of Justification by faith alone (and many others) are somehow no longer condemned by the Council of Trent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>Principles of Catholic Theology</em> (1982), p. 263: “<strong>That which in Luther makes all else bearable because of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the greatness of his spiritual fervor</span></strong>…”<a id="_ednref46" title="" href="#_edn46" name="_ednref46">[46]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 align="center"><strong>BENEDICT XVI ENCOURAGES METHODISTS TO ENTER INTO THE TOTALLY HERETICAL JOINT DECLARATION WITH THE LUTHERANS ON JUSTIFICATION, WHICH REJECTS THE COUNCIL OF TRENT</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>Address to Methodists</em>, Dec. 9, 2005: “<strong>I have been encouraged by the initiative</strong> which would bring the member churches of the World Methodist Council into association with the <strong>Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification</strong>, <strong>signed by the Catholic Church</strong> and the Lutheran World Federation in 1999.”<a id="_ednref47" title="" href="#_edn47" name="_ednref47">[47]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As covered already, the <em>Joint Declaration with the Lutherans on Justification</em> totally rejects the Council of Trent by teaching that its infallible canons no longer apply to the Lutherans.  Benedict XVI adheres to this Protestant agreement and asserts that it was signed by “the Catholic Church.”</p>
<h3 align="center"><strong>BENEDICT XVI PRAISES THE NON-CATHOLIC ECUMENICAL MONASTERY OF TAIZE AND SAYS MORE SHOULD BE FORMED</strong></h3>
<p>The ecumenical Monastery of Taize is located in France.  It is a <strong>monastery made up of over a hundred brothers from various non-Catholic denominations, including Protestants</strong>.<a id="_ednref48" title="" href="#_edn48" name="_ednref48">[48]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>Principles of Catholic Theology</em> (1982), p. 304: “…<strong>Taize has been, without a doubt, the leading example of an ecumenical inspiration</strong>…  <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Similar communities of faith and of shared living should be formed elsewhere</span></strong>…”<a id="_ednref49" title="" href="#_edn49" name="_ednref49">[49]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, more non-Catholic ecumenical monasteries should be formed, according to Benedict XVI.</p>
<h3 align="center"><strong>BENEDICT XVI GAVE COMMUNION TO THE PROTESTANT FOUNDER OF TAIZE</strong></h3>
<p align="center"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://www.mostholyfamilymonastery.com/Benedict_XVI_with_heretics_pictures/giving_Comm_to_Roger2.jpg" alt="Anti Pope Benedict XVI giving Communion to Bro. Roger Schutz" width="70%" border="0" /></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><em>Benedict XVI giving Communion to public heretic, Bro. Roger Schutz, the Protestant founder of Taize<a id="_ednref50" title="" href="#_edn50" name="_ednref50">[50]</a></em></h4>
<p>Benedict XVI gave Communion to Bro. Roger, the Protestant founder of the Taize community, on April 8, 2005.  And when Bro. Roger died in August, 2005, Benedict XVI said that this Protestant heretic went immediately to heaven.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI, Aug. 17, 2005, on Bro. Roger: "<strong>Bro. Roger Schutz</strong> [<strong>founder of a non-Catholic sect</strong>] is in the hands of eternal goodness, of eternal love; <strong>he has arrived at eternal joy</strong>…"<a id="_ednref51" title="" href="#_edn51" name="_ednref51">[51]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So much for the fact that Bro. Roger left the Catholic Church, rejected its dogmas for decades and became the founder of his own non-Catholic sect.  He still went to Heaven, according to Benedict XVI.  This is manifest heresy.  Benedict XVI even said that the heretic Bro. Roger is guiding us from on high.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>Address to Protestants at World Youth Da</em>y, August 19, 2005: “<strong>Bro. Roger Schutz</strong>… <strong>He is now visiting us and speaking to us from on high</strong>.<strong>”</strong><a id="_ednref52" title="" href="#_edn52" name="_ednref52">[52]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI also praised Bro. Roger’s “witness of faith.”<a id="_ednref53" title="" href="#_edn53" name="_ednref53">[53]</a>  If you believe that Benedict XVI is a Catholic pope, you might as well attend the Protestant church.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope St. Gregory the Great: “The holy universal Church teaches that it is not possible to worship God truly except in her <strong>and asserts that all who are outside of her will not be saved.”</strong><a id="_ednref54" title="" href="#_edn54" name="_ednref54">[54]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 align="center"><strong>BENEDICT XVI TEACHES THAT THE PROTESTANT “EUCHARIST” IS A SAVING EUCHARIST!</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>Pilgrim Fellowship of Faith,</em> 2002, p. 248: “<strong>Even a theology along the lines of the concept of [apostolic] succession, as is in force in the Catholic and in the Orthodox Church, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">should in no way deny the saving presence of the Lord in the Evangelical Lord’s Supper</span></strong>.”<a id="_ednref55" title="" href="#_edn55" name="_ednref55">[55]</a></p>
<p>John 6:54- “Amen, amen I say to you: except you eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, you shall not have life in you.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Protestants don’t have a valid Eucharist.  They don’t have valid bishops and priests, since they lack apostolic succession.  But Benedict XVI says above that even if one accepts the Catholic dogma of apostolic succession, one should in NO WAY DENY THE SAVING PRESENCE OF THE LORD <span style="text-decoration: underline;">IN THE EVANGELICAL PROTESTANT “LORD’S SUPPER</span>.”  According to Benedict XVI, the Protestants are not deprived of the saving Eucharistic Presence.  <strong>This means that you can get the saving Eucharistic presence at the local Protestant church.  This is astounding heresy.</strong></p>
<h3 align="center"><strong>BENEDICT XVI TEACHES THAT PROTESTANTISM (EVANGELICAL CHRISTIANITY) SAVES</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>Pilgrim Fellowship of Faith,</em> 2002, p. 251: “… the burdensome question of [apostolic] succession <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">does not detract from the spiritual dignity of Evangelical Christianity, or from the saving power of the Lord at work within it</span></strong>…”<a id="_ednref56" title="" href="#_edn56" name="_ednref56">[56]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a bold rejection of the dogma Outside the Church There is No Salvation.  If it were true, there would be absolutely no reason to be Catholic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Gregory XVI, <em>Summo Iugiter Studio</em> (# 2), May 27, 1832: “Finally some of these misguided people attempt to persuade themselves and others that men are not saved only in the Catholic religion, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">but that even heretics may attain eternal life</span>.”<a id="_ednref57" title="" href="#_edn57" name="_ednref57">[57]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 align="center"><strong>BENEDICT XVI SAYS THAT PROTESTANTISM IS NOT HERESY</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>The Meaning of Christian Brotherhood</em>, pp. 87-88: “The difficulty in the way of giving an answer is a profound one.  Ultimately it is due to the fact that <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">there is no appropriate category in Catholic thought for the phenomenon of Protestantism today</span></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> (one could say the same of the relationship to the separated churches of the East).  <strong>It is obvious that the old category of ‘heresy’ is no longer of any value</strong>.  <strong>Heresy, for Scripture and the early Church, includes the idea of a personal decision against the unity of the Church, and heresy’s characteristic is <em>pertinacia</em>, the obstinacy of him who persists in his own private way.  This, however, cannot be regarded as an appropriate description of the spiritual situation of the Protestant Christian</strong></span><strong>.</strong>  In the course of a now centuries-old history, <strong>Protestantism has made an important contribution to the realization of Christian faith, fulfilling a positive function</strong> in the development of the Christian message and, above all, often giving rise to a sincere and profound faith in <strong>the individual non-Catholic Christian, whose separation from the Catholic affirmation has nothing to do with the <em>pertinacia </em>characteristic of heresy.</strong>  Perhaps we may here invert a saying of St. Augustine’s: that an old schism becomes a heresy.  The very passage of time alters the character of a division, so that an old division is something essentially different from a new one.  Something that was once rightly condemned as heresy cannot later simply become true, but it can gradually develop its own positive ecclesial nature, with which the individual is presented as his church and in which he lives as a believer, not as a heretic.  This organization of one group, however, ultimately has an effect on the whole.  <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The conclusion is inescapable, then: Protestantism today is something different from heresy in the traditional sense, a phenomenon whose true theological place has not yet been determined</span></strong>.”<a id="_ednref58" title="" href="#_edn58" name="_ednref58">[58]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Protestantism is the rejection of <em>many</em> dogmas of the Catholic Faith.  Protestantism is not only heresy, but the most notorious collection of heresies with which the Church ever had to contend.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Pius XI, <em>Rerum omnium perturbationem</em> (# 4), Jan. 26, 1923: “…<strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the heresies begotten by the [Protestant] Reformation</span>.  It is in these <span style="text-decoration: underline;">heresies</span> that we discover the beginnings of that apostasy of mankind from the Church</strong>, the sad and disastrous effects of which are deplored, even to the present hour, by every fair mind.”<a id="_ednref59" title="" href="#_edn59" name="_ednref59">[59]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Benedict XVI tells us that Protestants are not heretics, and that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Protestantism itself is not heresy</span>.  This is undeniable proof that Benedict XVI is not a Catholic, but a complete heretic.  This is one of Benedict XVI’s worst heresies.</p>
<h3 align="center"><strong>BENEDICT XVI INDICATES AGAIN THAT UNITY WITH THE PROTESTANTS RESPECTS, NOT CONVERTS, THE MULTIPLICITY OF VOICES</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>Interview with Vatican Radio</em>, Aug. 5, 2006:<strong> “… the Evangelical [Protestant] Church.  </strong>If I am not mistaken,<strong> in Germany <span style="text-decoration: underline;">we have three important communities: Lutherans, Reformed, and Prussian Union</span>.  </strong>There are also several free Churches and within there are movements like the ‘Confessing Church,’ and so on.<strong>  It is therefore a collection of many voices with which we have to enter into dialogue, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">searching for unity while respecting the multiplicity of the voices with which we want to collaborate</span>.”</strong><a id="_ednref60" title="" href="#_edn60" name="_ednref60">[60]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He says he searches for unity with them while respecting multiplicity of voices.  This enunciates, once again, his position that they don’t need to abandon their heresies and that unity with them is not “ecumenism of the return.”</p>
<h3 align="center"><strong>BENEDICT XVI SPEAKS OF THE “RICHNESS” OF HERETICAL AND SCHISMATIC DENOMINATIONS</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>Address to Conference of Secretaries of Christian World Communions</em>, Oct. 27, 2006: <strong>“</strong>For decades the Conference of Secretaries of Christian World Communions has provided a forum for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">fruitful contacts between the various Ecclesial Communities</span>.  This has enabled their representatives to build that reciprocal trust needed to engage seriously <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">in bringing the richness of different Christian traditions</span></strong> toserve the common call of discipleship.”<a id="_ednref61" title="" href="#_edn61" name="_ednref61">[61]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 align="center"><strong>BENEDICT XVI’S HERESIES AGAINST THE SACRAMENTS </strong></h3>
<p>In 2001, the Vatican approved a document with the Assyrian Schismatic Church of the East.  The document says that members of the Vatican II Church can go to the schismatic church and receive Communion and vice versa.  The document was approved by Benedict XVI.  The problem with this document, besides the fact that the Assyrian schismatics are not Catholics, is that this schismatic liturgy has <span style="text-decoration: underline;">no words of consecration</span>, no “institution narrative.”  Benedict XVI mentioned the problem in his book <em>Pilgrim Fellowship of Faith</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>Pilgrim Fellowship of Faith,</em> 2002, p. 232: “…<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This case needed special studies to be made, because the Anaphora of Addai and Mari most commonly in use by the Assyrians does not include an institution narrative.  But these difficulties were able to be overcome</span></strong>…”<a id="_ednref62" title="" href="#_edn62" name="_ednref62">[62]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI admits that this schismatic liturgy has no “institution narrative,” which is the words of consecration.  But he still approved receiving Communion at this schismatic liturgy which has <span style="text-decoration: underline;">no words of consecration</span>.</p>
<p>Benedict XVI came to this incredible decision because he denies that words are necessary for a valid consecration!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>Principles of Catholic Theology</em> (1982), p. 377: “…we are witnesses today of <strong>a new integralism</strong> [read: traditionalism] that may seem to support what is strictly Catholic <strong>but in reality corrupts it to the core</strong>.  It produces a passion of suspicions, the animosity of which is far from the spirit of the gospel.  <strong>There is an obsession with the letter that regards the liturgy of the Church as invalid and thus puts itself outside the Church.  It is forgotten here that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the validity of the liturgy depends primarily, not on specific words, but on the community</span></strong> of the Church...”<a id="_ednref63" title="" href="#_edn63" name="_ednref63">[63]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a total rejection of Catholic sacramental teaching.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Eugene IV, Council of Florence, 1439: “<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">All these sacraments are made up of three elements</span></strong>: namely, things as the matter, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">words as the form</span></strong>, and the person of the minister who confers the sacrament with the intention of doing what the Church does.  <strong>If any of these is lacking, the sacrament is not effected</strong>.”<a id="_ednref64" title="" href="#_edn64" name="_ednref64">[64]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fact that Benedict XVI holds that Masses without any words of consecration are valid proves that he doesn’t even have a whiff of the Catholic Faith.  He is a manifest heretic against the Church’s sacramental teaching.  And this heresy is repeated in a number of his books.</p>
<h3 align="center"><strong>BENEDICT XVI SAYS THAT INFANT BAPTISM HAS NO REASON TO EXIST</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>Principles of Catholic Theology</em>, 1982, p. 43: “<strong>The conflict over infant baptism shows the extent to which we have lost sight of the true nature of faith</strong>, baptism and membership in the Church… It is obvious also that the meaning of baptism is destroyed wherever it is no longer understood as an anticipatory gift but only as a self-contained rite.  <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Wherever it is severed from the catechumenate, baptism loses its <em>raison d’etre</em></span></strong>[its reason to be].”<a id="_ednref65" title="" href="#_edn65" name="_ednref65">[65]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an incredible, astounding and gigantic heresy!  Benedict XVI says that wherever baptism is severed from the catechumenate – for example, in infant baptism – it loses its reason to be.  Infant baptism has no meaning or purpose, according to Benedict XVI.  That is why in his book <em>God and the World, </em>Benedict XVI <strong>REJECTS THE NECESSITY OF INFANT BAPTISM AS “UNENLIGHTENED.”</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>God and the World</em>, 2000, p. 401: “Q. …<em>what happens to the millions of children who are killed in their mothers’ wombs</em>?  A. …<strong>the question about children who could not be baptized because they were aborted then presses upon us that much more urgently.  Earlier ages had <span style="text-decoration: underline;">devised</span> a teaching <span style="text-decoration: underline;">that seems to me rather unenlightened</span></strong>.  They said that baptism endows us, by means of sanctifying grace, with the capacity to gaze upon God.  Now, certainly, the state of original sin, from which we are freed by baptism, consists in a lack of sanctifying grace.  Children who die in this way are indeed without any personal sin, so they cannot be sent to Hell, but, on the other hand, they lack sanctifying grace and thus the potential for beholding God that this bestows.  They will simply enjoy a state of natural blessedness, in which they will be happy.  This state people called limbo.  In the course of our century, <strong>that has gradually come to seem problematic to us</strong>.  <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This was one way in which people sought to justify the necessity of baptizing infants as early as possible, but the solution is itself questionable</span>.”</strong><a id="_ednref66" title="" href="#_edn66" name="_ednref66">[66]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He says that earlier ages “had devised” (not received from Christ) the teaching about the necessity of baptizing infants for them to attain sanctifying grace.  He says that this teaching is “unenlightened”!  This is gross heresy.  It was infallibly defined by the Councils of Florence and Trent that the Sacrament of Baptism is necessary for salvation, and that infants who die without the Sacrament of Baptism cannot be saved.</p>
<p>Some may wonder why, then, Ratzinger practices infant baptism?  It’s because he sees no problem practicing and going through the motions with something that, to him, has no meaning or purpose.  In the same way, he poses as “the pope” even though he doesn’t even believe in the primacy of supreme jurisdiction of the popes, as proven already.  In the same way, he poses as the head of the Church of Jesus Christ when he doesn’t even believe that Jesus Christ is necessarily the Messiah, as proven already.</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong>BENEDICT XVI’S HERESIES AGAINST SACRED SCRIPTURE</strong></h2>
<p>The Catholic Church teaches that Sacred Scripture is the infallible and inerrant word of God.  Vatican I also declared that all those things in the written word of God must be believed with divine and Catholic Faith.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Pius IX, <em>Vatican I</em>, Sess. III, Chap. 3, <em>ex cathedra</em>: “Further, by divine and Catholic faith, <strong>all those things must be believed which are contained in the written word of God</strong> and in tradition, and those which are proposed by the Church, either in a solemn pronouncement or in her ordinary and universal teaching power, to be believed as divinely revealed.”<a id="_ednref67" title="" href="#_edn67" name="_ednref67">[67]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 align="center"><strong>BUT BENEDICT XVI SAYS THAT SACRED SCRIPTURE’S CREATION ACCOUNT IS BASED ON PAGAN CREATION ACCOUNTS</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>A New Song for the Lord,</em> 1995, p. 86: “<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The pagan creation accounts on which the biblical story is in part based</span></strong> end without exception in the establishment of a cult, but the cult in this case is situated in the cycle of the <em>do ut des</em>.”<a id="_ednref68" title="" href="#_edn68" name="_ednref68">[68]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the biblical creation account in the book of Genesis is based in part on pagan creation accounts, this means that the biblical account is neither original nor inspired directly by God.  This statement from Benedict XVI is heresy and shows again that he is a faithless apostate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Leo XIII, <em>Providentissimus Deus</em> (# 20), Nov. 18, 1893: “<strong>For all the books which the Church receives as sacred and canonical, are written wholly and entirely, with all their parts, at the dictation of the Holy Ghost</strong>; and so far is it from being possible that any error can co-exist with inspiration, that inspiration not only is essentially incompatible with error, but excludes and rejects it as absolutely and necessarily as it is impossible that God Himself, the supreme Truth, can utter that which is not true.  <strong>This is the ancient and unchanging faith of the Church, solemnly defined in the Councils of Florence and of Trent</strong>, and finally confirmed and more expressly formulated by the Council of the Vatican.”<a id="_ednref69" title="" href="#_edn69" name="_ednref69">[69]</a></p>

<h3 align="center"><strong>BENEDICT XVI CALLS INTO DOUBT THE STONE TABLETS OF THE EXODUS ACCOUNT</strong></h3>

<p>Benedict XVI, <em>God and the World</em>, 2000, p. 76: “<em>Q.  In the beginning the earth was bare and empty; God had not yet made it rain, is what it says in Genesis.  <strong>Then God fashioned man,</strong> and for this purpose he took ‘dust from the field and blew into his nostrils the breath of life; thus man became a living creature.’  The breath of life – is that the answer to the question of where we come from?  </em>A<strong>.  </strong>I think we have here a most important image, which presents a significant understanding of what man is.  It suggests that man is one who springs from the earth and its possibilities.  <strong>We can even read into this representation something like evolution</strong>.”<a id="_ednref72" title="" href="#_edn72" name="_ednref72">[72]</a></p>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>God and the World</em>, 2000, p. 139: “<strong>The Christian picture of the world is this, that the world in its details is the product of a long process of evolution</strong> but that at the most profound level it comes from the Logos.” <a id="_ednref73" title="" href="#_edn73" name="_ednref73">[73]</a></p>

<h2 align="center"><strong>BENEDICT XVI’S HERESIES AND APOSTASY WITH ISLAM</strong></h2>
<p>Islam is a false religion which rejects the Trinity and the Divinity of Our Lord.  The Catholic Church officially teaches that Islam is an abomination – a false religion from which people need to be converted and saved.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Eugene IV, <em>Council of Basel</em>, 1434: “… there is hope that very many from <strong>the abominable sect of Mahomet </strong>will be converted to the Catholic faith.”<a id="_ednref74" title="" href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[74]</a></p>
<p>Pope Callixtus III: “I vow to… exalt the true Faith, and to extirpate <strong>the diabolical sect of the reprobate and faithless Mahomet</strong> [Islam] in the East.”<a id="_ednref75" title="" href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[75]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 align="center"><strong>BENEDICT XVI HAS “DEEP RESPECT” FOR THE FALSE RELIGION OF ISLAM</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>General Audience</em>, Sept. 20, 2006: “<strong>I hope that in the various circumstances during my Visit – </strong>for example, when in Munich I emphasized how important it is to respect what is sacred to others –<strong> that my deep respect for the great religions, and especially the Muslims, who ‘worship God…’ appeared quite clear</strong>!”<a id="_ednref76" title="" href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[76]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice that he has “deep respect” for not only the false religion of Islam, but other false religions.  This is apostasy.  Also notice that he considers respect for the false religion itself as the same thing as respecting Muslim “believers.”  He speaks of the two interchangeably, as we see.  This is important to keep in mind because Benedict XVI frequently says that he respects Muslim believers or <em>Muslims as believers</em>.  In so doing he is respecting their false religion, as we see proven clearly in the next quote.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>Address</em>, Dec. 22, 2006: “My visit to Turkey afforded me the opportunity to show also publicly <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">my respect for the Islamic Religion</span></strong>, <strong>a respect, moreover, which the Second Vatican Council (declaration <em>Nostra Aetate</em> #3) pointed out</strong> to us as an attitude that is only right.”<a id="_ednref77" title="" href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4">[77]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice that Benedict XVI admits here that Vatican II itself teaches respect for the false religion of Islam.</p>
<h3 align="center"><strong>BENEDICT XVI SAYS THERE IS A NOBLE ISLAM</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>Salt of the Earth</em>, 1996, p. 244: “And, to prescind from the schism between Sunnites and Shiites, it [Islam] also exists in many varieties.  <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">There is a noble Islam</span></strong>, embodied, for example, by the King of Morocco, and there is also the extremist, terrorist Islam, which, again, one must not identify with Islam as a whole, which would do it an injustice.”<a id="_ednref78" title="" href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5">[78]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He is saying that a false religion is good.  This is apostasy.</p>
<h3 align="center"><strong>BENEDICT XVI SAYS THAT ISLAM REPRESENTS GREATNESS</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>Truth and Tolerance</em>, 2004, p. 204: “<strong>In Hinduism (which is actually a collective name for a whole multitude of religions) there are some marvelous elements</strong> – but there are also negative aspects: involvement with the caste system; suttee [self immolation] for widows, which developed from beginnings that were merely symbolic; offshoots of the cult of the goddess Sakti – all these might be mentioned to give just a little idea.  <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Yet even Islam, with all the greatness it represents</span></strong>, is always in danger of losing balance, letting violence have a place and letting religion slide away into mere outward observance and ritualism.”<a id="_ednref79" title="" href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6">[79]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He says that Islam, a false religion which rejects the Divinity of Jesus Christ and the entire Catholic Faith, represents “greatness.”  This is apostasy.   <strong>Islam represents infidelity, the rejection of the Trinity and darkness</strong>.  It’s also interesting to note that while speaking of the “marvelous elements” in Hinduism, Benedict XVI mentions negative aspects such as the caste system, etc.  He doesn’t mention the fact that Hinduism worships false gods among the negative aspects.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>Address to Representatives of Islam</em>, August 20, 2005: “<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The believer – and all of us, as Christians and Muslims, are believers</span></strong> – … <strong>You guide Muslim believers and train them in the Islamic faith...</strong>  <strong>You, therefore, have a great responsibility for the formation of the younger generation</strong>.”<a id="_ednref80" title="" href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7">[80]</a></p>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>Catechesis</em>, August 24, 2005: “This year is also the 40th anniversary of the conciliar Declaration <em>Nostra Aetate</em>, which has ushered in a new season of dialogue and spiritual solidarity between Jews and Christians, as well as <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">esteem for the other great religious traditions</span></strong>.  <strong>Islam occupies a special place among them</strong>.”<a id="_ednref81" title="" href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8">[81]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice that Benedict XVI doesn’t merely esteem the members of false religions, but the false religions themselves.  This is apostasy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>Address</em>, Sept. 25, 2006: “<strong>I would like to reiterate today all the esteem and the profound respect that I have for Muslim believers</strong>, calling to mind the words of the Second Vatican Council which for the Catholic Church are the magna Carta of Muslim-Catholic dialogue: ‘The Church looks upon Muslims with respect.  They worship the one God living and subsistent… At this time <strong>when for Muslims the spiritual journey of the month of Ramadan is beginning, I address to all of them my cordial good wishes</strong>, praying that the Almighty may grant them serene and peaceful lives.  May the God of peace fill you with the abundance of his Blessings, together with the communities you represent!”<a id="_ednref82" title="" href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9">[82]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI respects the believers of this diabolical sect; he says they worship God; he wishes them God’s blessings during their “spiritual journey” of Ramadan.  This is simply apostasy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>Angelus Address</em>, Oct. 22, 2006: “I am happy to send <strong>a cordial greeting to the Muslims of the entire world who are celebrating</strong> in these days the conclusion of the month of the <strong>Ramadan</strong> fast.”<a id="_ednref83" title="" href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10">[83]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 align="center"><strong>BENEDICT XVI ESTEEMS ISLAMIC CIVILIZATIONS</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>General Audience</em>, Dec. 6, 2006: “<strong>I thus had the favorable opportunity to renew my sentiments of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">esteem for the Muslims and for the Islamic civilizations</span></strong>.”<a id="_ednref84" title="" href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11">[84]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Islamic civilizations are among the most evil and anti-Christian things in history.  This statement by Benedict XVI, therefore, is complete apostasy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>Address in Turkey to Muslim figures</em>, Nov. 28, 2006: “… I was pleased to express my profound esteem for all the People of this great Country and to pay my respects at the tomb of the founder of modern Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk… <strong>I extend my greetings to all the religious leaders of Turkey, especially the Grand Muftis</strong> of Ankara and Istanbul.  In your person, Mr. President, <strong>I greet all the Muslims in Turkey with particular esteem</strong> and affectionate regard… <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This noble Land has also seen a remarkable flowering of Islamic civilization</span></strong> in the most diverse fields… <strong>There are so many Christian and Muslim monuments that bear witness to Turkey’s glorious past.  You rightly take pride in these</strong>, preserving them for the admiration of the ever-increasing number of visitors who flock here… <strong>As believers, we draw from our prayer the strength that is needed </strong>to overcome all traces of prejudice and to bear joint witness to our firm faith in God.”<a id="_ednref85" title="" href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12">[85]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He first mentions that he paid respects at the tomb of the nonbeliever Ataturk.  He then says that he esteems <em>all the Muslims in Turkey</em>.  To esteem someone is to admire him.  This means that he admires all the Muslims in Turkey.  That means that he not only admires millions who reject Christ, but even the criminals among the Muslims in Turkey; for certainly there are some.  He then praises the “remarkable flowering of Islamic civilization,” which keeps millions in darkness and infidelity.  He then praises <em>the Muslim monuments</em> of the past, and says that Muslims “rightly take pride in these.”  Finally, he says that as “believers” Muslims can draw strength from their prayer – indicating that the practice of Islam is true and authentic.  Benedict XVI is a complete and utter apostate.</p>
<h3 align="center"><strong>BENEDICT XVI TEACHES THAT ISLAM AND CHRISTIANITY HAVE THE SAME GOD</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>Pilgrim Fellowship of Faith,</em> 2002, p. 273: “… <strong>Islam, too</strong>, … <strong>has inherited from Israel and the Christians the same God</strong>…”<a id="_ednref86" title="" href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13">[86]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Islam and Christianity don’t have the same God.  The followers of Islam reject the Trinity.  Christians worship the Trinity.</p>
<h3 align="center"><strong>BENEDICT XVI SAYS HE RESPECTS THE KORAN AS THE HOLY BOOK OF A GREAT RELIGION</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>speech apologizing for his comments on Islam</em>, Sept. 2006: “In the Muslim world, this quotation has unfortunately been taken as an expression of my personal position, thus arousing understandable indignation.  I hope that the reader of my text can see immediately that this sentence does not express <strong>my personal view of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the Qur’an, for which I have the respect due to the holy book of a great religion</span></strong>.”<a id="_ednref87" title="" href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14">[87]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI respects the Koran as a holy book of a great religion.  The Koran blasphemes the Trinity, denies the Divinity of Christ, and says those who believe in it are as excrement.  It also says that all Christians are damned.  This statement by Benedict XVI is total apostasy.  We already covered how John Paul II kissed the Koran; this is to kiss the Koran in words.</p>
<h3 align="center"><strong>BENEDICT XVI GOES INTO A MOSQUE AND PRAYS TOWARD MECCA LIKE THE MUSLIMS</strong></h3>
<p>On Nov. 30, 2006, during his trip to Turkey, Benedict XVI took off his shoes and entered the Blue Mosque.  He followed the Muslim’s command to turn toward “the Kiblah” – the direction of Mecca.  Then the prayer began.  Benedict XVI prayed like the Muslims toward Mecca in the mosque.  He even crossed his arms in the Muslim prayer gesture called “the gesture of tranquility.”  This incredible act of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">apostasy</span> was reported and shown all over the mainstream media.  It’s no exaggeration to say that Benedict XVI was initiated into Islam.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI “Hailed for Praying like Muslims Toward Mecca,” Dec 1, 2006 — ISTANBUL <strong>(Reuters) – “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pope Benedict ended a sensitive, fence-mending visit to Turkey on Friday amid praise for visiting Istanbul's famed Blue Mosque and praying there facing toward Mecca ‘like Muslims.</span>’</strong>… ‘The Pope's dreaded visit was concluded with a wonderful surprise,’ wrote daily Aksam on its front page.  ‘<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In Sultan Ahmet Mosque, he turned toward Mecca and prayed like Muslims</span>,’</strong> the popular daily Hurriyet said, using the building's official name… ‘I would compare the Pope's visit to the mosque to Pope John Paul's gestures at the Western Wall,’ said veteran Vatican mediator Cardinal Roger Etchegaray, referring to Pope John Paul II's prayers at Jerusalem's Western Wall in 2000.  ‘Yesterday, Benedict did with the Muslims what John Paul did with the Jews.’”<a id="_ednref88" title="" href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15">[88]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This absolutely proves that Benedict XVI is an apostate.  This is one of the most scandalous actions in human history.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>St. Thomas Aquinas, <em>Summa Theologica</em>, Pt. I-II, Q. 103., A. 4: “All ceremonies are professions of faith, in which the interior worship of God consists.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Now man can make profession of his inward faith, by deeds as well as by words</span>: and in either profession, if he makes a false declaration, he sins mortally.”</p>
<p>St. Thomas Aquinas, <em>Summa Theologica</em>, Pt. II, Q. 12, A. 1, Obj. 2: <strong>“… if anyone were to… worship at the tomb of Mahomet, he would be deemed an apostate.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>St. Thomas says that one who worships at the tomb of Mahomet is to be deemed an apostate; <strong>praying in a mosque, and toward Mecca like the Muslims, is much worse.  </strong>That’s why no pope in history <em>ever even went into a mosque</em>; they all knew that to even go there would be to signify the acceptance of the false religion.  With this action, <strong>the debate about whether Benedict XVI is the pope is utterly and completely over</strong> for anyone familiar with these facts and in possession of a modicum of good will.  Tell your friends and relatives: Benedict XVI is a heretic, an apostate and therefore an antipope.</p>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>General Audience</em>, Dec. 6, 2006: “<strong>In the area of interreligious dialogue, </strong>divine Providence granted me, almost at the end of my Journey,<strong> an unscheduled Visit which proved rather important: my Visit to Istanbul’s famous Blue Mosque.  Pausing for a few minutes of recollection in that place of prayer</strong>, I addressed the one Lord of Heaven and Earth, the Merciful Father of all humanity.”<a id="_ednref89" title="" href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16">[89]</a></p>
<h2 align="center"><strong>BENEDICT XVI’S HERESIES WITH PAGANISM</strong></h2>
<h3 align="center"><strong>BENEDICT XVI FULLY FAVORS ECUMENISM AND THE DEVIL-WORSHIPPING ECUMENICAL CEREMONIES AT ASSISI</strong></h3>
<p>We’ve already covered John Paul II’s notorious ecumenical gatherings at Assisi in 1986 where he prayed with over 130 different religious leaders of all kinds of false and demonic religions, putting the true religion on a par with idol worship.  This activity is totally condemned by Catholic Tradition.  It was denounced as apostasy by Pope Pius XI.</p>
<p>Well, the train that took the false religious leaders from the Vatican to the 2002 Assisi event (the repeat performance) was described by Benedict XVI as <strong>“a symbol of our pilgrimage in history</strong>… the <strong>reconciliation <span style="text-decoration: underline;">of peoples and religions</span>, a great inspiration…</strong>”<a id="_ednref90" title="" href="#_edn90" name="_ednref90">[90]</a></p>
<p>In 2006, Benedict XVI also praised the 1986 interreligious prayer meeting at Assisi.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI, Message, Sept. 2, 2006:  “<strong>This year is the 20th anniversary of the <em>Interreligious Meeting of Prayer for Peace</em></strong>, desired by my venerable Predecessor John Paul II on 27 October 1986 in Assisi.  It is well known that he did not only invite Christians of various denominations to this Meeting but also <strong>the exponents of different religions</strong>.  <strong>It constituted a vibrant message</strong> furthering peace and an event that left its mark on the history of our time… attestations of the close bond that exists between the relationship with God and the ethics of love are recorded in <strong>all great religious traditions</strong>.<br />“Among the features of the 1986 Meeting, it should be stressed that <strong>this value of prayer in building peace was testified to by the representatives of different religious traditions</strong>, and this did not happen at a distance but in the context of a meeting… We are in greater need of this dialogue than ever… <strong>I am glad, therefore, that the initiatives planned in Assisi this year are along these lines</strong> and, in particular, that the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue has had the idea of applying them in a special way for young people… I gladly take this opportunity to greet the representatives of <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">other religions</span></strong> who are taking part in one or other of the Assisi commemorations.  Like us Christians, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">they know that in prayer it is possible to have a special experience of God</span></strong> and to draw from it effective incentives for dedication to the cause of peace.”<a id="_ednref91" title="" href="#_edn91" name="_ednref91">[91]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI is in favor of the apostate ecumenical gatherings at Assisi where John Paul II prayed with leaders of all kinds of demonic and idolatrous religions – where John Paul II had the crucifixes removed from Catholic rooms so that pagans could worship false gods.  Notice that Benedict XVI says that other religions know that prayer gives them an experience of God.  This means that their religious experiences, such as worshipping false gods in prayer, are true.</p>
<h3 align="center"><strong>BENEDICT XVI CRITICIZES AS “HOTHEADS” THOSE WHO DESTROYED PAGAN TEMPLES </strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>God and the World</em>, 2000, p. 373: “<strong>There were in fact Christian hotheads and fanatics who destroyed temples, who were unable to see paganism as anything more than idolatry</strong> that had to be radically eliminated.”<a id="_ednref92" title="" href="#_edn92" name="_ednref92">[92]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those “hotheads” whom he criticizes would include St. Francis Xavier and St. Benedict.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>St. Francis Xavier [regarding the heathen children he had converted to the Catholic faith, +1543): “<strong>These children… show an ardent love for the Divine law, and an extraordinary zeal for our holy religion and imparting it to others.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Their hatred for idolatry is marvelous</span>.  They get into feuds with the heathens about it</strong>… <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The children run at the idols, upset them, dash them down, break them to pieces, spit on them, trample on them, kick them about, and in short heap on them every possible outrage</span></strong>.”<a id="_ednref93" title="" href="#_edn93" name="_ednref93">[93]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>St. Benedict overthrew a pagan altar and burned the groves dedicated to Apollo when he first arrived at Mount Cassino:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Pius XII, <em>Fulgens Radiatur</em> (# 11), March 21, 1947: “… he [St. Benedict] went south and arrived at a fort ‘called Cassino situated on the side of a high mountain; <strong>on this stood an old temple where Apollo was worshipped by the foolish country people, according to the custom of the ancient heathens</strong>.  Around it likewise grew groves, in which even till that time <strong>the mad multitude of infidels used to offer their idolatrous sacrifices.</strong>  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The man of God coming to that place broke the idol, overthrew the altar, burned the groves, and of the temple of Apollo made a chapel of St. Martin</span>.  Where the profane altar had stood he built a chapel of St. John; and by continual preaching he converted many of the people thereabout.’”<a id="_ednref94" title="" href="#_edn94" name="_ednref94">[94]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 align="center"><strong>BENEDICT XVI TELLS US THAT PAGAN AND IDOLATROUS RELIGIONS ARE HIGH AND PURE</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>Salt of the Earth</em>, 1996, p. 23: “And so we can also see that <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">in the Indian religious cosmos (‘Hinduism’ is a rather misleading designation for a multiplicity of religions) there are very different forms: very high and pure ones</span></strong> that are marked by the idea of love, but also wholly gruesome ones that include ritual murder.”<a id="_ednref95" title="" href="#_edn95" name="_ednref95">[95]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He says that idolatrous religions are high and pure.  This is heresy and apostasy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 Cor. 10:20- “… the things which the heathens sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God.”</p>
<p>Pope Leo XIII, <em>Ad Extremas</em> (#1), June 24, 1893: “… the blessed Apostle Thomas who is rightly called the founder of preaching the Gospel to the Hindus.  Then, there is Francis Xavier… Through his extraordinary perseverance, <strong>he converted <span style="text-decoration: underline;">hundreds of thousands of Hindus from the myths and vile superstitions of the Brahmans to the true religion</span></strong>.”<a id="_ednref96" title="" href="#_edn96" name="_ednref96">[96]</a></p>

</blockquote>
<p>Notice that Benedict XVI doesn’t merely respect the members of false faiths, but he shows PROFOUND RESPECT for the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">false faiths</span> themselves!  This is apostasy.  This means that he respects the denial of Christ, the rejection of the Papacy, the endorsement of contraception and abortion, etc. (which are all part of the teaching of other “faiths”).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Leo XIII, <em>Custodi di Quella fede</em> (# 15), Dec. 8, 1892: “Everyone should avoid familiarity or friendship with anyone suspected of belonging to masonry or to affiliated groups.  Know them by their fruits and avoid them.  <strong>Every familiarity should be avoided, not only with those impious libertines who openly promote the character of the sect, but also with those who hide under the mask of universal tolerance, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">respect for all religions</span></strong>...”<a id="_ednref98" title="" href="#_edn98" name="_ednref98">[98]</a></p>

<h3 align="center"><strong>BENEDICT XVI SAYS THEOLOGY MUST LEARN FROM THE EXPERIENCES OF FALSE RELIGIONS</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>Special Address</em>, Sept. 12, 2006:<strong> “For philosophy and, albeit in a different way, for theology, listening to the great experiences and insights of the religious traditions </strong>of humanity, and those of the Christian faith in particular,<strong> is a source of knowledge, and to ignore it would be an unacceptable restriction of our listening and responding.”<a id="_ednref100" title="" href="#_edn100" name="_ednref100">[100]</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI says that Catholic theology should listen to the “great experiences” and “insights” of false religions, and that to ignore them would be irresponsible.  People should think about the significance of such a statement.  It clearly indicates that he doesn’t regard these religions (including pagan and idolatrous ones) as false and of the Devil.  His statement is simply another expression of the Modernist apostasy that all religions are basically true because one becomes a believer through one’s religious “experiences.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope St. Pius X, <em>Pascendi</em> (# 14), Sept. 8, 1907: <strong>“[According to the Modernists]  It is this <em>experience</em> which, when a person acquires it, makes him properly and truly a believer</strong>.  How far off we are here from Catholic teaching we have already seen in the decree of the Vatican Council.  We shall see later how, with such theories, added to the other errors already mentioned, the way is opened wide for atheism.  Here it is well to note at once that, <strong>given this doctrine of <em>experience</em> united with the other doctrine of <em>symbolism</em>, every religion, even that of paganism, must be held to be true.  What is to prevent such experiences from being met within every religion?  In fact that they are to be found is asserted by not a few.  And with what right will Modernists deny the truth of an experience affirmed by a follower of Islam?  With what right can they claim true experiences for Catholics alone?</strong>  Indeed Modernists do not deny but actually admit, some confusedly, others in the most open manner, that all religions are true.  That they cannot feel otherwise is clear.”<a id="_ednref101" title="" href="#_edn101" name="_ednref101">[101]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 align="center"><strong>BENEDICT XVI DENYING OUTSIDE THE CHURCH THERE IS NO SALVATION</strong></h2>
<p>What we have seen thus far proves many times over that Benedict XVI rejects the defined dogma Outside the Catholic Church There is No Salvation.  Benedict XVI holds that we shouldn’t even convert heretics and schismatics.  But here are some more examples of heresy where Benedict XVI specifically addresses and denies this crucial dogma.</p>
<h3 align="center"><strong>BENEDICT XVI ADDRESSES OUTSIDE THE CHURCH THERE IS NO SALVATION AND COMPLETELY REJECTS IT </strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>Salt of the Earth</em>, 1996, p. 24: “Q.  <strong><em>But could we not also accept that someone can be saved through a faith other than the Catholic?</em></strong>  A.  That’s a different question altogether.  <strong>It is definitely possible for someone to receive from his religion directives that help him become a pure person, which also, if we want to use the word, help him please God and reach salvation.  This is not at all excluded by what I said; on the contrary, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">this undoubtedly happens on a large scale</span></strong>.”<a id="_ednref102" title="" href="#_edn102" name="_ednref102">[102]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Church teaches that there is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">no</span> salvation outside of the Church.  Benedict XVI teaches that there is undoubtedly salvation outside the Church on a large scale.  This is a bold rejection of the dogma Outside the Church There is No Salvation.</p>
<h3 align="center"><strong>BENEDICT XVI SAYS THAT THERE ARE PAGAN SAINTS</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>Truth and Tolerance</em>, 2004, p. 207: “<strong>The fact that in every age there have been, and still are, ‘pagan saints’ </strong>is because everywhere and in every age – albeit often with difficulty and in fragmentary fashion – the speech of the ‘heart’ can be heard, because God’s Torah may be heard within ourselves...”<a id="_ednref103" title="" href="#_edn103" name="_ednref103">[103]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is bold heresy.  Remember, Pope Eugene IV infallibly defined that all who die as “pagans” are not saved.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Eugene IV, <em>Council of Florence</em>, <em>ex cathedra</em>: “…all those who are outside the Catholic Church, not only <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">pagans</span></strong> but also Jews or heretics and schismatics, cannot share in eternal life…”<a id="_ednref104" title="" href="#_edn104" name="_ednref104">[104]</a></p>

<h3 align="center"><strong>BENEDICT XVI TEACHES THAT THERE ARE MANY WAYS THAT LEAD TO HEAVEN BESIDES THE CHRISTIAN FAITH</strong></h3>

<p>Benedict XVI, <em>Co-Workers of the Truth,</em> 1990, p. 217: “<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The question that really concerns us, the question that really oppresses us, is why it is necessary for us in particular to practice the Christian Faith in its totality; why, when there are so many other ways that lead to heaven and salvation</span></strong>, it should be required of us to bear day after day the whole burden of ecclesial dogmas and of the ecclesial ethos.  And so we come again to the question: What exactly is Christian reality?  What is the specific element in Christianity that not merely justifies it, but makes it compulsorily necessary for us?  <strong>When we raise the question about the foundation and meaning of our Christian existence, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">there slips in a certain false hankering for the apparently more comfortable life of other people who are also going to heaven</span></strong>.  We are too much like the laborers of the first hour in the parable of the workers in the vineyard (Mt. 20:1-16).  Once they discovered that they could have earned their day’s pay of one denarius in a much easier way, they could not understand why they had had to labor the whole day.  <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">But what a strange attitude it is to find the duties of our Christian life unrewarding just because the denarius of salvation can be gained without them</span>!</strong>  It would seem that we – like the workers of the first hour – want to be paid not only with our own salvation, but more particularly with others’ lack of salvation.  That is at once very human and profoundly un-Christian.”<a id="_ednref105" title="" href="#_edn105" name="_ednref105">[105]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI asks that all-important question: Why is it necessary to practice the Christian Faith if there are other ways to salvation?  Benedict XVI answers the question by admitting that there are many other ways besides the Christian Faith that lead to salvation.  He even criticizes people for asking such a question.</p>
<p>Benedict XVI has bluntly rejected a revealed truth of the Catholic Faith: Jesus Christ is the only way to salvation, and the Catholic Faith is necessary for salvation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Leo XII, <em>Ubi Primum</em> (# 14), May 5, 1824: “… by divine faith we hold one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and that no other name under Heaven is given to men except the name of Jesus Christ in which we must be saved.  This is why we profess that there is no salvation outside the Church.”<a id="_ednref106" title="" href="#_edn106" name="_ednref106">[106]</a></p>

<p>Benedict XVI, <em>Feast of Faith,</em> 1981, p. 130: “<strong>The Council of Trent concludes its remarks on Corpus Christi with something which offends our ecumenical ears and has doubtless contributed not a little toward discrediting this feast</strong> <strong>in the opinion of our Protestant brethren.  But <span style="text-decoration: underline;">if we purge its formulation</span></strong> of the passionate tone of the sixteenth century, we shall be surprised by something great and positive.”<a id="_ednref108" title="" href="#_edn108" name="_ednref108">[108]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI says the Council of Trent’s infallible declaration “offends” his ecumenical ears and that its “formulation” needs to be “purged,” which means to <em>make clean</em> or <em>rid of objectionable elements</em>!  This is totally heretical.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI could not be more formally heretical.  He is admitting that Vatican II’s teaching (which he adheres to) is directly contrary to the teaching of the Magisterium in the Syllabus of Errors condemned by Pope Pius IX.  We have shown that Vatican II’s teaching on religious liberty contradicts traditional Catholic teaching.  Benedict XVI just admitted it.  One could hardly ask for more of a confirmation that the teaching of Vatican II is heretical.  In his book, Benedict XVI repeats this again and again, calling the teaching of Vatican II “the countersyllabus,” and saying that there can be no return to the Syllabus of Errors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>Principles of Catholic Theology</em>, 1982, p. 385: "By a kind of inner necessity, therefore, the optimism of<strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the countersyllabus</span> gave way</strong> to a new cry that was far more intense and more dramatic than the former one."<a id="_ednref117" title="" href="#_edn117" name="_ednref117">[117]</a></p>

<h2 align="center"><strong>BENEDICT XVI TOTALLY REJECTS THE UNITY OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH</strong></h2>
<p>The unity or oneness of the Catholic Church is a very important dogma.  It’s one of the four marks of the Church, as in <em>one, holy, Catholic and apostolic</em>.  When heretics form sects, they don’t break the unity of the Catholic Church, since the unity of the Church cannot be broken.  They  simply leave the Catholic Church.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Leo XIII, <em>Satis Cognitum</em> (# 4), June 29, 1896: "<strong>The Church in respect of its unity belongs to the category of</strong> <strong>things indivisible by nature…</strong>"<a id="_ednref124" title="" href="#_edn124" name="_ednref124">[124]</a></p>

<h3 align="center"><strong>BUT BENEDICT XVI TOTALLY REJECTS THE DOGMA OF THE UNITY OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>Principles of Catholic Theology</em> (1982), p. 121: “…it is also ultimately through these factors that it becomes clear that <strong>the unity of the Church is not to be brought about by human effort</strong> but can be effected only by the Holy Spirit.”<a id="_ednref126" title="" href="#_edn126" name="_ednref126">[126]</a></p>

<p>Benedict XVI teaches that the Church was united in the First Millennium, but divided after that time by the schismatic revolt and the Protestant revolt.  This is a total repudiation of one of the four marks of the Catholic Church; it alone would prove that he is not a Catholic.</p>

<h2 align="center"><strong>OTHER HERESIES OF BENEDICT XVI</strong></h2>
<h3 align="center"><strong>BENEDICT XVI SAYS JUDAS MIGHT NOT BE IN HELL</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI, Oct. 18, 2006: “This poses two questions when it comes to explaining what happened [with Judas].  The first consists in asking ourselves how it was possible that Jesus chose this man and trusted him.  In fact, though Judas is the group's administrator (cf. John 12:6b; 13:29a), in reality he is also called "thief" (John 12:6a).  The mystery of the choice is even greater, as Jesus utters a very severe judgment on him: "Woe to that man by whom the son of man is betrayed!" (Matthew 26:24).  <strong>This mystery is even more profound if one thinks of his eternal fate</strong>, <strong>knowing that Judas "repented and brought back the 30 pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders, saying 'I have sinned in betraying innocent blood</strong>'" (Matthew 27:3-4).  <strong>Though he departed afterward to hang himself (cf. Matthew 27:5), <span style="text-decoration: underline;">it is not for us to judge his gesture, putting ourselves in God's place, who is infinitely merciful and just</span></strong>.”<a id="_ednref129" title="" href="#_edn129" name="_ednref129">[129]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These words of Benedict XVI indicate that he holds that Judas might not be in Hell.  This is a denial of the Gospel.  If Judas is not in Hell (as Benedict XVI indicates is possible), then Our Lord’s words in Matthew 26:24 (quoted below) would be false.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Woe to that man by whom the Son of man shall be betrayed: <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">it were better for him, if that man had not been born</span></strong>" (Matthew 26:24).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If Judas didn’t go to Hell, then he went to Purgatory or Heaven.  In that case, Our Lord (the all knowing God) could not have said that it is better for Judas not to have been born.  That’s very clear and very simple; but these simple truths of the Catholic Faith are all thrown out the window by the non-Catholic Vatican II sect.</p>
<p>It’s quite interesting that, in this speech, Benedict XVI quotes the first part of Matthew 26:24 ("Woe to that man by whom the son of man is betrayed!"), but not the last part (“<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">it were better for him, if that man had not been born</span></strong>”).  You can see his omission of that critical part of the passage in the citation above.  That’s a striking example of a heretic cutting out the part of the Gospel that he doesn’t like or is about to deny!</p>
<p>Further refuting Antipope Benedict XVI is the fact that Our Lord also says that Judas is “lost” and calls him the “son of perdition,” which means “the son of damnation.”  Judas also ended his life with the mortal sin of suicide.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>John 17:12- "<strong>None of them is lost, but the son of perdition</strong>, that the scripture may be fulfilled.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Catholic Church has always held that Judas went to Hell, based on the clear words of Our Lord.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>St. Alphonsus, <em>Preparation For Death</em>, p. 127: “<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Poor Judas! Above seventeen hundred years have elapsed since he has been in Hell</span>, and his Hell is still only beginning.</strong>”<a id="_ednref130" title="" href="#_edn130" name="_ednref130">[130]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But just like the other defined dogmas on salvation, even the clearest words and messages of the Gospel are denied by the non-Catholic, manifestly heretical Vatican II sect and its antipopes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope St. Pius X, <em>Pascendi </em>(# 3), Sept. 8, 1907: “<strong>Moreover, they [the Modernists] lay the ax not to the branches and shoots, but to the very root, that is, to the faith and its deepest fibers</strong>.  And once having struck at this root of immortality, they proceed to diffuse poison through the whole tree, so that <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">there is no part of Catholic truth which they leave untouched, none that they do not strive to corrupt</span></strong>.”<a id="_ednref131" title="" href="#_edn131" name="_ednref131">[131]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 align="center"><strong>BENEDICT XVI RESPECTS HANS KUNG’S PATH OF DENIAL OF JESUS CHRIST!</strong></h3>
<p>For those who don’t know, Hans Kung denies Papal Infallibility and the Divinity of Our Lord Jesus Christ, among other things.  Hans Kung can correctly be described as an Arian, since he denies that Our Lord is of the same substance as the Father.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>Salt of the Earth</em>, 1996, pp. 95-96: “Q. And about Hans Kung’s path?  I mean, he now hopes for a rehabilitation.  A. … <strong>he [Hans Kung] has taken back nothing of his contestation of the papal office; indeed, he has further radicalized his positions.  In Christology and in trinitarian theology he has further distanced himself from the faith of the Church.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I respect his path</span>, which he takes in accord with his conscience</strong>, but he should not then demand the Church’s seal of approval but should admit that in essential questions he has come to different, very personal decisions of his own.”<a id="_ednref132" title="" href="#_edn132" name="_ednref132">[132]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI doesn’t merely say that he respects Hans Kung, which would be bad enough; he says that he respects his path<strong> – </strong>that is, the denial of Jesus Christ!  This is total apostasy.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>BENEDICT XVI SAYS IT’S IMPORTANT THAT EVERY PERSON CAN BELONG TO THE RELIGION OF HIS CHOICE</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>Address</em>, May 18, 2006: “Likewise, peace is rooted in respect for religious freedom, which is a fundamental and primordial aspect of the freedom of conscience of individuals and the freedom of peoples<strong>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">It is important that everywhere in the world every person can belong to the religion of his choice</span></strong>and practice it freely without fear, <strong>for no one can base his life on the quest of material being alone.</strong>”<a id="_ednref133" title="" href="#_edn133" name="_ednref133">[133]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to Benedict XVI, it’s important that every person can belong to the religion of his choice.  This is more religious indifferentism.  Benedict XVI then explains his reason for saying this: “<strong><em>for no one can base his life on the quest of material being alone</em>.”  </strong>In other words, life is more than material being; there is a spiritual reality, so it’s important to embrace a religion – any religion of your choice!  What an apostate.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>BENEDICT XVI UTTERS MORE HERESY ON RELIGIOUS LIBERTY, DIRECTLY CONTRADICTING THE DOGMATIC TEACHING OF POPE PIUS IX</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>Address to ambassador of Spain</em>, May 20, 2006: “<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Church also insists on the inalienable right of individuals to profess their own religious faith without hindrance, both publicly and privately</span></strong>, as well as the right of parents to have their children receive an education that complies with their values and beliefs without explicit or implicit discrimination.”<a id="_ednref134" title="" href="#_edn134" name="_ednref134">[134]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is precisely the opposite of the infallible teaching of the Catholic Church.  The Church condemns the very thing he said the Church insists!  See for yourself how clearly opposed Benedict XVI’s teaching is to the dogmatic teaching of Pope Pius IX.  Notice especially <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the underlined portion</span>, and compare it to the teaching of Benedict XVI:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Pius IX, <em>Quanta Cura</em> (#’s 3-6), Dec. 8, 1864, <strong><em>ex cathedra</em></strong>: <strong>“</strong>From which totally false idea of social government they do not fear to foster that erroneous opinion, most fatal in its effects on the Catholic Church and the salvation of souls, called by Our predecessor, Gregory XVI, an insanity, <strong>NAMELY, THAT ‘LIBERTY OF CONSCIENCE AND WORSHIP IS EACH MAN’S PERSONAL RIGHT, WHICH OUGHT TO BE LEGALLY PROCLAIMED AND ASSERTED IN EVERY RIGHTLY CONSTITUTED SOCIETY</strong>; and that a right resides in the citizens to an absolute liberty, which should be restrained by no authority whether ecclesiastical or civil, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">WHEREBY THEY MAY BE ABLE OPENLY AND PUBLICLY TO MANIFEST AND DECLARE ANY OF THEIR IDEAS WHATEVER</span>, EITHER BY WORD OF MOUTH, BY THE PRESS, OR IN ANY OTHER WAY</strong>.  But while they rashly affirm this, they do not understand and note that they are preaching liberty of perdition…  Therefore, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BY OUR APOSTOLIC AUTHORITY, WE REPROBATE, PROSCRIBE, AND CONDEMN ALL THE SINGULAR AND EVIL OPINIONS AND DOCTRINES SPECIALLY MENTIONED IN THIS LETTER</span></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">,</span> AND WILL AND COMMAND THAT THEY BE THOROUGHLY HELD BY ALL THE CHILDREN OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AS REPROBATED, PROSCRIBED AND CONDEMNED.”<a id="_ednref135" title="" href="#_edn135" name="_ednref135">[135]</a></p>

<p>Benedict XVI, <em>Introduction to Christianity</em>, 2004, p. 349: “<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">It now becomes clear that the real heart of faith in the resurrection does not consist at all in the idea of the restoration of bodies</span></strong>, to which we have reduced it in our thinking; such is the case even though this is the pictorial image used throughout the Bible.”<a id="_ednref139" title="" href="#_edn139" name="_ednref139">[139]</a></p>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>Introduction to Christianity</em>, p. 353: “The foregoing reflections may have clarified to some extent what is involved in <strong>the biblical pronouncements about the resurrection: their essential content is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not the conception of a restoration of bodies to souls</span></strong> after a long interval…”<a id="_ednref140" title="" href="#_edn140" name="_ednref140">[140]</a></p>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>Introduction to Christianity, </em>2004, pp. 357-358: “To recapitulate, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Paul teaches, not the resurrection of physical bodies</span></strong>, but the resurrection of persons…”<a id="_ednref141" title="" href="#_edn141" name="_ednref141">[141]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can see that Benedict XVI denies this dogma in his book <em>Introduction to Christianity</em> (as quoted above) by teaching that St. Paul <span style="text-decoration: underline;">doesn’t</span> teach the resurrection of physical bodies, and that the resurrection does <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> consist in the restoration of bodies.  This is astounding heresy.</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong>Benedict XVI giving <em>El Diablo</em> satanic sign</strong></h2>
<p align="center"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://www.mostholyfamilymonastery.com/Benedict_XVI_Pictures_Miscellany/benedictsalute.jpg" alt="Anti Pope Benedict XVI giving El Diablo satanic sign" width="588" height="807" /></p>
<p>Below we see Benedict XVI giving <em>El Diablo </em>(the Devil) sign.  This satanic gesture is popular among Satanists and satanic rock groups.  <strong>Many give this satanic hand gesture without knowing it because they’re taken over by the evil spirit</strong>.  Some point out that the Devil sign is similar to the hand gesture for “I love you” in sign language.  That’s true, but that’s probably because <strong>the inventor of the deaf signing system, Helen Keller, was herself an occultist and a Theosophist</strong>.  She wrote a book called <em>My Religion</em> in which she explained her occult views.<a id="_ednref142" title="" href="#_edn142" name="_ednref142">[142]</a>  Some believe that she designed the “I love you” sign to correspond with the Devil sign so that one making it would be saying that he or she loves Satan.</p>
<p>Regardless, we believe that above Benedict XVI is giving the Devil sign – the double Devil sign, in fact – and that he knows what he’s doing.  We say this because, having read many of his books, we can say that he is clearly one of the most intelligent men in the world, in addition to having an encyclopedic knowledge of matters Catholic.  Thus, when he repeatedly says in his books that one is free <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> to see Jesus as the Messiah (as we’ve documented), <strong>Benedict XVI (being an extremely knowledgeable man) knows very well that he is preaching a new anti-Christian Gospel from inside the physical structures of the Catholic Church</strong>, all the while posing as the pope who is supposedly dedicated to the Gospel.  Thus, he is fully aware of the evil deception which he is pulling off.  <strong>Only a person who knowingly worships Satan or is very controlled or possessed by Satan could do such a thing</strong>.</p>
<h2 align="center">CONCLUSION ABOUT BENEDICT XVI</h2>
<p><strong>Benedict XVI is a manifest heretic</strong>.  We have proven this without any doubt.  He teaches that Our Lord may not be the Messiah; that the Old Covenant is valid; that Jews and others can be saved without believing in Christ; that schismatics and Protestants don’t need conversion; that non-Catholics are not bound to accept Vatican I; that Protestant Monasteries should be formed; that Protestantism is not even heresy; that Mass is valid without words of consecration; that infant baptism has no purpose; that Scripture is filled with myths; that the false religion of Islam is noble; that pagan religions are high; that salvation can be had outside the Church; that Catholic dogmas need to be purged; that Vatican II rejected Catholic teaching on religious liberty; that the unity of the Church does not exist; and that the Resurrection of the Body will not occur, <em>just to name a few. </em></p>
<p><strong>Since he is a heretic, he could not have been a validly elected pope.  </strong>As quoted already, Pope Paul IV solemnly taught in his Feb. 15, 1559 Bull, <em>Cum ex Apostolatus officio</em>, that it is impossible for a heretic to be validly elected pope.</p>
<p>Therefore, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">according to the teaching of the Catholic Church, Benedict XVI is not a pope, but a non-Catholic antipope whom Catholics must completely reject</span></strong>.  He presides over the new religion of Vatican II, a counterfeit Catholicism that has abandoned the Catholic Church’s traditions and dogmas.</p>
<p>One of Benedict XVI’s main characteristics is that he is a deceiver.  While he teaches undeniable, astounding and manifest heresies, one of the ways by which he has convinced so many that he is conservative is that, among these astounding heresies in his writings, there are many conservative passages.  But this is nothing new.  Pope Pius VI pointed out that heretics, inspired by the Devil, have always used such tactics to inculcate heresies and deceive people.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Pius VI, Bull “Auctorem fidei," August 28, 1794: <strong>“[The Ancient Doctors] knew the capacity of innovators in the art of deception.</strong>  In order not to shock the ears of Catholics, <strong>they sought to hide the subtleties… by the use of seemingly innocuous words such as would allow them to insinuate error into souls in the most gentle manner</strong>. Once the truth had been compromised, they could, <strong>by means of slight changes or additions in phraseology, distort the confession of the faith</strong> which is necessary for our salvation, and lead the faithful by subtle errors to their eternal damnation.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pope Pius VI points out that camouflaging the heresies in statements that are ambiguous or seemingly conservative or contradictory was the tactic of the heretic Nestorius, and that Catholics cannot allow heretics to get away with this or deceive them by it.  They must hold such heretics to their heresies regardless:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Pius VI, “Auctorem fidei": “… it cannot be excused in the way that one sees it being done, <strong>under the erroneous pretext that the seemingly shocking affirmations in one place are further developed along orthodox lines in other places, and even in yet other places corrected; as if allowing for the possibility of either affirming or denying the statement… such has always been the fraudulent and daring method used by innovators to establish error.  It allows for both the possibility of promoting error and of excusing it.<br /></strong>"…It is a most reprehensible technique for the insinuation of doctrinal errors and one condemned long ago by our predecessor Saint Celestine who found it used in the writings of Nestorius, Bishop of Constantinople, and which he exposed in order to condemn it with the greatest possible severity.  Once these texts were examined carefully, the impostor was exposed and confounded, for he expressed himself in a plethora of words, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">mixing true things with others that were obscure</span>; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">mixing at times one with the other in such a way that he was also able to confess those things which were denied while at the same time possessing a basis for denying those very sentences which he confessed</span>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Heretics have always used ambiguity and deception to insinuate their heresies and make them seem not quite as bad.  In fact, the more deceptive the heretic is usually equates to how successful he is for the Devil.  The heretic Arius effectively spread his denial of the Divinity of Christ because he impressed people with his appearance of ascetism and devotion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Pius XI, <em>Rite expiatis</em> (# 6), April 30, 1926: “…<strong>heresies gradually arose and grew in the vineyard of the Lord, propagated either by open heretics or by sly deceivers</strong> who, because they professed a certain austerity of life and gave a false appearance of virtue and piety, easily led weak and simple souls astray.”<a id="_ednref143" title="" href="#_edn143" name="_ednref143">[143]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pope Pius VI concludes his point by giving Catholics instructions on how to deal with such deception or ambiguity among the writings of heretics:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In order to expose such snares, something which becomes necessary with a certain frequency in every century, no other method is required than the following: <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">WHENEVER IT BECOMES NECESSARY TO EXPOSE STATEMENTS WHICH DISGUISE SOME SUSPECTED ERROR OR DANGER UNDER THE VEIL OF AMBIGUITY, ONE MUST DENOUNCE THE PERVERSE MEANING UNDER WHICH THE ERROR OPPOSED TO CATHOLIC TRUTH IS CAMOUFLAGED</span>.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pope Pius VI teaches us that if someone veils a heresy in ambiguity, a Catholic must hold him to the heretical meaning and denounce the heretical meaning which is camouflaged in ambiguity.  But this is only common sense: if a man says that he is against abortion, but repeatedly votes in favor of it, he is a supporter of abortion and a heretic.  The fact that he sometimes claims to hold Church teaching against abortion means nothing.</p>
<p>Likewise, the fact that Benedict XVI says some conservative, ambiguous or contradictory things doesn’t change the fact that he teaches astounding heresies and is not a Catholic.</p>
<h3 align="center"><strong>BENEDICT XVI’S RETRACTION OF HIS STATEMENT ON ISLAM REVEALS HIS TRUE NATURE AS A DECEIVER</strong></h3>
<p>Almost all of those who are reading this book probably heard about Benedict XVI’s controversial remarks about Muhammad in a speech in Bavaria on Sept. 12, 2006.  In this now-famous speech, Benedict XVI quoted a medieval emperor who denounced Muhammad’s policy (and therefore Islam) as evil and inhuman.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>Speech in Bavaria</em>, Sept. 12, 2006: “In the seventh conversation... the emperor touches on the theme of the holy war… saying: ‘<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Show me just what Muhammad brought that was new, and there you will find things only evil and inhuman, such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached</span></strong>.’  <strong>The emperor, after having expressed himself so forcefully, goes on to explain in detail the reasons why spreading the faith through violence is something unreasonable</strong>. <strong>Violence is incompatible with the nature of God and the nature of the soul</strong>.  ‘God,’ he says, ‘is not pleased by blood - and not acting reasonably is contrary to God's nature.’”<a id="_ednref144" title="" href="#_edn144" name="_ednref144">[144]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In context, we can clearly see that Benedict XVI doesn’t merely quote the statement from the emperor against Muhammad’s policy, but he endorses the statement of the emperor.</p>
<p>So, why would Benedict XVI make a statement against Islam?  Is it because he believes that Islam is evil?  Of course not.  Benedict XVI has said that Islam represents “greatness” (<em>Truth and Tolerance</em>, p. 204).  Benedict XVI fully endorses Vatican II’s teaching in favor of Islam, as we saw already.  Benedict XVI thinks that John Paul II – who loved the false religion of Islam and committed countless acts of apostasy praising it – was a great pope worthy of canonization.  The reason that Benedict XVI made this one statement is simply because his mission is, as we’ve pointed out, <em>to occasionally make some conservative statements and do some conservative things in order to deceive traditionalist-minded folks</em> back into the clutches of the false Church – all the while preaching the Vatican II apostasy.  And this one conservative statement had its intended effect, <em>until God allowed it to backfire on him</em>.</p>
<p>Immediately after Benedict XVI’s Sept. 12 speech got around, we were contacted by individuals who had, in the past, struggled with issues pertaining to whether or not the antipopes are true popes.  One of the individuals wrote to us and made reference to Benedict XVI’s speech on Islam; his faith against the Counter Church was clearly weakening.  It’s truly pathetic and actually <em>disgusting</em> that one conservative statement or action here or there from the antipope – even though the antipope denies Christ, worships at the synagogue, says we shouldn’t convert Protestants, etc., etc., etc. – is all this person’s weak faith needed to see to be obliterated.</p>
<p>But that’s the way it is with many.  They don’t have a true faith in Christ, they don’t hate evil, or their faith is as fragile as a reed.  Many of them can be swept away by a single conservative statement here or there, <em>even from a well-documented public heretic and apostate who doesn’t even believe that Jesus is the Messiah</em>, as we’ve proven.  That’s why Benedict XVI, who is thoroughly under the power of the Devil, does this type of thing.</p>
<h3 align="center"><strong>THE TRUTH COMES OUT: BENEDICT XVI APOLOGIZES FOR HIS SPEECH ON ISLAM AND SAYS THAT THE STATEMENT AGAINST MUHAMMAD’S TEACHING DOESN’T “IN ANY WAY EXPRESS” HIS PERSONAL THOUGHT!</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Benedict XVI, <em>Apology for his Sept. 12, 2006 speech</em>: “At this time, I wish also to add that I am deeply sorry for the reactions in some countries to a few passages of my address at the University of Regensburg, which were considered offensive to the sensibility of Muslims.  <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">These in fact were a quotation from a medieval text, which do not in any way express my personal thought</span></strong>.”<a id="_ednref145" title="" href="#_edn145" name="_ednref145">[145]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is very, very interesting on a number of levels.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">First</span>, this is ABSOLUTE PROOF THAT BENEDICT XVI IS A LIAR AND A DECEIVER.  It proves that he is a liar because <span style="text-decoration: underline;">we already saw that Benedict XVI clearly endorsed the quote from the emperor</span> in the speech on Sept. 12.  That is undeniable.  <strong>But now he is saying that the statement from the emperor <span style="text-decoration: underline;">doesn’t in any way express his personal thought</span></strong>, which totally contradicts the Sept. 12 speech.  Thus, no matter which way you look at it, <strong>Benedict XVI is caught in a huge lie</strong>.</p>
<p>Second, in addition to PROVING that Benedict XVI is a public liar and a deceiver, his statement that the quote from the emperor doesn’t in any way express his personal thought proves that he is an apostate.  For in the face of the reaction to his speech, he had every chance to stand by his ostensible position that Islam is evil.  He was presented with a great opportunity during the swirling controversy to persuade people that the position of his speech was proven true by the Muslims’ evil reaction and desire to kill; but no… he repudiated the statement against Islam instead.  He followed it up by being initiated into Islam by prayer toward Mecca in a mosque with a mufti on Nov. 30, 2006.</p>
<p>Thus, what was originally surely intended as a neat plan by the Devil, through his Antipope Benedict XVI, to make a conservative statement which would deceive certain “traditionalists” was foiled when God allowed the plan to backfire after the Muslim reaction became so volatile that Benedict XVI had to apologize and reveal his true feelings – <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">thus obliterating his credibility with anyone who has eyes to see what a liar he therefore has proven himself to be</span></strong>.</p>
<p>So don’t be fooled if the manifest heretic and raging liar, Antipope Benedict XVI, says or does something else that is conservative with the intention of deceiving traditionalists.  <strong>Don’t be fooled if Benedict XVI grants a universal indult to say the Latin Mass at a time when most of the priests are invalid and would have to accept the Vatican II apostasy to take advantage of it.  The Devil will concede all of this as long as one accepts Benedict XVI’s new religion, or accepts Benedict XVI and his apostate Bishops as Catholics while they teach that Jesus Christ and the Catholic Faith are meaningless.  Don’t be fooled if he reaches out in other ways to traditionally-minded groups to keep them under, or bring them back to, the Vatican II sect.</strong></p>
<p>It won’t change the fact that he is a manifest heretic who presides over a non-Catholic sect.</p>
<p>This is all part of the deception of the last days which is predicted in Catholic prophecy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our Lady of La Salette, France, Sept. 19, 1846: <strong>“Rome will lose the Faith and become the seat of the Anti-Christ… the Church will be in eclipse.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This prophecy of La Salette coincides with the prophecies in Sacred Scripture (Apocalypse 17 and 18) that the city of seven hills (Rome) will become a harlot (a counterfeit Church), as we will cover later.  The great harlot prophesied in the Bible is not the Catholic Church; it is the counterfeit Catholic Church (the Vatican II sect), the apostate, phony bride which arises in the last days to deceive Catholics and eclipse the true Church which has been reduced to a remnant.</p>
<p>We have shown that Our Lady’s message at La Salette has been fulfilled before our very eyes: Benedict XVI and the Vatican II sect teach that Jews are perfectly free not to believe in Jesus Christ.  This is published in Benedict XVI’s and the Vatican’s own books; it proves that Rome has become the seat of antichrist.  A series of antipopes reigning from Rome has made Rome the seat of the Antichrist.</p>
<p>Our Lord also indicates that in the last days there will be “the abomination of desolation” “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">in the holy place</span>” (Mt. 24:15).  He tells us that there will be a deception so profound that, if it were possible, even the elect would be deceived (Mt. 24:24).  He even asks if there would be any Faith left on the earth:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Luke 18:8 “But yet the Son of man, when He cometh, shall He find, think you, faith on earth?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>This deception will happen in the very heart of the Church’s physical structures –</strong> <strong>in “the Temple of God” (2 Thess. 2:4) and “the holy place” (Mt. 24:15)</strong> – and will arise because people receive not the love of the truth.  God allows this as the supreme punishment for the world’s sins.  We are currently living through this apostasy and deception.  People need to completely reject Antipope Benedict XVI, the other Vatican II antipopes, and the new Vatican II religion.</p>
<p>Benedict XVI is one of the most wicked men in human history, for he alleges to wield the authority of the Church of Christ while teaching that one is free to deny Jesus Christ.  He alleges to be the pope while he teaches that people are free to reject the Papacy.  He alleges to be the leader of the Christian Faith, while teaching that Our Lord Jesus Christ doesn’t even have to be seen as the Messiah.</p>
