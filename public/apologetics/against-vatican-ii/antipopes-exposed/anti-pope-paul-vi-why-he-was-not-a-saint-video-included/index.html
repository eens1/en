<blockquote><spanstyle="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>“How could a successor of Peter have caused in so short a time more damage to the Church than the Revolution of 1789?...</strong> the deepest and most excessive in Her history… <strong>what no heresiarch has ever succeeded in doing?... Do we really have a pope or an intruder sitting on the Chair of Peter?</strong>”<a id="_ednref1" title="" href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a> (Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, commenting on Paul VI’s reign in 1976)</span></blockquote>
<p align="center"><a title="Anti-Pope Paul VI Ephod" href="https://www.mostholyfamilymonastery.com/Paul_VI_pictures/paul6_withring2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.mostholyfamilymonastery.com/Paul_VI_pictures/paul6_withring_small.jpg" alt="Anti-Pope Paul VI" width="260" height="338" /></a></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Paul VI</strong></p>
Paul VI was the man who claimed to be the head of the Catholic Church from June 21, 1963 to August 6, 1978.  <strong>He was the man who promulgated the Second Vatican Council and the New Mass.  We’ve already seen that the evidence indicates that the man who preceded and elevated Paul VI, John XXIII, was a Freemason and a manifest heretic.  We’ve also seen that the documents of Vatican II contain many heresies, and that the New Mass, which Paul VI eventually promulgated, represented a liturgical revolution.</strong>
<p>Paul VI solemnly ratified all 16 documents of Vatican II.  It is not possible for a true pope of the Catholic Church to solemnly ratify teachings that are heretical.  As we will show in more detail later in this book, the fact that Paul VI did solemnly ratify the heretical teachings of Vatican II proves that Paul VI was not a true pope, but an antipope.</p>
<p>It’s important to keep in mind that Paul VI was the one who gave the world the New Mass, the other new “sacraments,” and the heretical teachings of Vatican II.  If you go to the New Mass or</p>
<p>embrace the teachings of Vatican II, <strong>the confidence that you have that these things are legitimate is directly connected to the confidence that you have that Paul VI was a true Catholic pope</strong>.</p>
<p>We will now expose the amazing heresies of Paul VI.  We will show, from his official speeches and writings, that Paul VI was a complete apostate who was not even remotely Catholic.  All of the official speeches and writings of the men who claim to be pope are contained in the Vatican’s</p>
<p>weekly newspaper, <em>L’ Osservatore Romano</em>.  The Vatican has reprinted issues of their newspaper from April 4, 1968 to the present.  From those speeches, we will now prove that Paul VI was not a true pope because of the irrefutable and undeniable evidence that he was a complete heretic and an apostate.</p>
<blockquote>Paul VI, <em>General Audience</em>, Dec. 6, 1972: “Does God exist?  Who is God?  And what knowledge can man have of him?  What relationship must each of us have with him?  To answer each of these questions would lead us to endless and complex discussions…”<a id="_ednref2" title="" href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a></blockquote>
These questions don’t lead us to endless and complex discussions.  Does God exist?  Yes.  Who is God?  The Holy Trinity.  What knowledge can man have of him?  The Catholic Faith.  What relationship must each of us have with him?  To belong to the Church He established.  Paul VI is stating that these are endless and complex questions.  No Catholic would assert such nonsense, which mocks and renders meaningless the Catholic Faith and the true God.
<blockquote>Paul VI, <em>General Audience</em>, June 27, 1973: “…<strong>everything must change, everything must progress.  Evolution seems to be the law that brings liberation</strong>.  There must be a great deal that is true and good in this mentality…”<a id="_ednref3" title="" href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[3]</a></blockquote>
Here Paul VI explicitly states and approves the Modernist blasphemy that everything is in a state of evolution.  His heresy was explicitly condemned by Pope Pius X.
<blockquote>Pope Pius X, <em>Pascendi </em>(# 26), Sept. 8, 1907, explaining the doctrine of the Modernists: <strong>“To the laws of evolution everything is subject – dogma, Church, worship, the Books we revere as sacred, even faith itself</strong>…”<a id="_ednref4" title="" href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4">[4]</a></blockquote>
<h3 align="center"><strong>PAUL VI ON NON-CHRISTIAN RELIGIONS</strong></h3>
The Catholic Church teaches that all non-Catholic religions are false.  There is only one true Church, outside of which no one can be saved.  This is Catholic dogma.
<blockquote>Pope St. Gregory the Great, 590-604: “The holy universal Church teaches that it is not possible to worship God truly except in her <strong>and asserts that all who are outside of her will not be saved.”<a id="_ednref5" title="" href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5"><strong>[5]</strong></a></strong></blockquote>
All of the other religions belong to the Devil.  This is the teaching of Jesus Christ, the Catholic Church and Sacred Scripture.  See 1 Cor. 10:20 and Psalm 95:5.  Anyone who shows esteem for non-Christian religions, or regards them as good or deserving of respect, denies Jesus Christ and is an apostate.
<blockquote>Paul VI, General Audience, Nov. 8, 1972: “Ecumenism began in this way; as respect for non-Christian religions…”<a id="_ednref6" title="" href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6">[6]</a>
<p>Pope Pius XI, <em>Mortalium Animos</em> (# 2), Jan. 6, 1928: “…that false opinion which considers all religions to be more or less good and praiseworthy&hellip;  Not only are those who hold this opinion in error and deceived, but also in distorting the idea of true religion they reject it&hellip;”<a id="_ednref7" title="" href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7">[7]</a></blockquote>
Here is more of what Paul VI thought about non-Christian religions of the Devil:</p>
<blockquote>Paul VI, <em>Address</em>, Sept. 22, 1973: “…<strong>noble non-Christian religions</strong>…”<a id="_ednref8" title="" href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8">[8]</a></blockquote>
This is apostasy – a total rejection of Jesus Christ.
<blockquote>Paul VI, <em>General Audience</em>, Jan. 12, 1972: “…a disconcerting picture opens up before our eyes: that of religions, <strong>the religions invented by man; attempts that are sometimes extremely daring and noble</strong>…”<a id="_ednref9" title="" href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9">[9]</a></blockquote>
Here Paul VI says that religions <strong>invented by man</strong> are sometimes extremely noble!  This is apostasy – a rejection of Jesus Christ and the Catholic Faith.
<blockquote>Paul VI, <em>Message</em>, Dec. 6, 1977: “…non-Christian religions, which the Church respects and esteems…”<a id="_ednref10" title="" href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10">[10]</a></blockquote>
He is saying that he <span style="text-decoration: underline;">esteems</span> false religions.
<blockquote>Paul VI, <em>Message</em>, Nov. 24, 1969: “…overcome divisions, by <strong>developing a mutual respect between the different religious confessions</strong>.”<a id="_ednref11" title="" href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11">[11]</a>
<p>Paul VI, <em>Address</em>, Dec. 3, 1970: “We greet with <strong>respect</strong> the representatives of <strong>all the other religions who have honored us by their presence</strong>.”<a id="_ednref12" title="" href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12">[12]</a></p>
<p>Paul VI, <em>General Audience</em>, July 6, 1977: “<strong>We welcome with sincere respect</strong> the Japanese delegation of <strong>the Konko-kyo religion</strong>.”<a id="_ednref13" title="" href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13">[13]</a></p>
<p>In his <em>Address</em>, Aug. 22, 1969, Paul VI praised the Hindu Gandhi, and stated that he was: “Ever conscious of God’s presence…”<a id="_ednref14" title="" href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14">[14]</a></blockquote>
Hindus are pagans and idolaters who worship many different false gods.  For Paul VI to praise the notorious Hindu Gandhi as “ever-conscious of God’s presence” shows again that Paul VI was a complete religious indifferentist.  Paul VI also officially praised the false religion of Hinduism in the official Vatican II document <em>Nostra Aetate #2 </em>(on non-Christian religions), as we quoted in the section on Vatican II.</p>
<blockquote>Paul VI, <em>Apostolic Exhortation</em>, Dec. 8, 1975: “The Church respects and esteems these non-Christian religions…”<a id="_ednref15" title="" href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15">[15]</a></blockquote>
Notice again that Paul VI <span style="text-decoration: underline;">esteems false religions</span>; this is satanic.
<blockquote>Paul VI, <em>Address</em>, Aug. 24, 1974: “Religious and cultural differences in India, as you have said, are honored and respected<strong>… We are pleased to see that this mutual honor and esteem is practiced</strong>…”<a id="_ednref16" title="" href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16">[16]</a></blockquote>
Paul VI says that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">religious differences are honored</span> in India and that he is pleased to see this.  This means that he honors the worship of false gods.
<blockquote>Paul VI, <em>Address to Synod of Bishops</em>, Sept. 2, 1974: “Likewise we cannot omit a reference to <strong>the non-Christian religions.  These, in fact, must no longer be regarded as rivals, or obstacles to Evangelization</strong>…”<a id="_ednref17" title="" href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17">[17]</a></blockquote>
Here Paul VI boldly reveals that he is preaching a new Gospel.  Non-Christian religions, he tells us, are no longer our obstacle to evangelization.  This is an antichrist religion of apostasy.
<blockquote>Pope Gregory XVI, <em>Mirari Vos</em> (# 13), Aug. 15, 1832: “They should consider the testimony of Christ Himself that ‘those who are not with Christ are against Him,’ (Lk. 11:23) and that they disperse unhappily <span style="text-decoration: underline;">who do not gather with Him</span>. <strong> Therefore, ‘without a doubt, they will perish forever, unless they hold the Catholic faith whole and inviolate’</strong> <strong>(Athanasian Creed)</strong>.”<a id="_ednref18" title="" href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18">[18]</a>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Paul VI, <em>Address to Dalai Lama</em>, Sept. 30, 1973: “We are happy to welcome Your Holiness today… You come to us from Asia, the cradle of <strong>ancient religions and human traditions which are rightly held in deep veneration</strong>.”<a id="_ednref19" title="" href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19">[19]</a></span></blockquote>
Paul VI tells us that it is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">right</span> to hold false religions which worship false gods in “deep veneration”!  This may be the worst heresy that Paul VI uttered.</p>
<blockquote>Paul VI, Address, August, 1969: “…Uganda includes differing faiths which respect and <em>esteem one another</em>.”<a id="_ednref20" title="" href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20">[20]</a></blockquote>
The true religion esteems false religions?  No, this again is blatantly heretical.
<blockquote>Paul VI, <em>Message to Pagan Shinto Priests</em>, March 3, 1976: “<strong>We</strong> <strong>know the fame of your temple, and the wisdom that is represented so vividly by the images contained therein</strong>.”<a id="_ednref21" title="" href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21">[21]</a></blockquote>
This is one of the most evil, revealing and heretical statements that Paul VI ever uttered.  He is praising the wisdom contained in the images in the pagan Shinto Temple; in other words, he is praising the idols of the Shintoists!
<p align="center"><strong>PAUL VI ON BUDDHISM</strong></p>
Buddhism is a false, pagan religion of the East which teaches belief in re-incarnation and karma.  Buddhists hold that life is not worth living, and that every form of conscious existence is an evil.  Buddhists worship various false gods.  Buddhism is an idolatrous and false religion of the Devil.  Here’s what Paul VI thought about Buddhism:
<blockquote><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Paul VI, <em>General Audience to Japanese Buddhists</em>, Sept. 5, 1973: “<strong>It is a great pleasure for us to welcome the members of the Japanese Buddhists Europe Tour, honored followers of the Soto-shu sect of Buddhism</strong>… At the Second Vatican Council the Catholic Church exhorted her sons and daughters to study and evaluate the religious traditions of mankind and to ‘<strong>learn by sincere and patient dialogue what treasures</strong> a bountiful God has distributed among the nations of the earth’ (<em>Ad Gentes</em>, 11)… <strong>Buddhism is one of the riches of Asia</strong>…”<a id="_ednref22" title="" href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22">[22]</a></span></blockquote>
According to Paul VI, the false, pagan and idolatrous religion of Buddhism is one of the “riches” of Asia!
<blockquote>Paul VI, <em>General Audience to Japanese Buddhist Mission Tour</em>, Oct. 24, 1973: “Once again it is our pleasure to welcome a distinguished group of the Japan Buddhist Mission Tour.  We are happy to reiterate the esteem we have for your country, <strong>your noble traditions</strong>…”<a id="_ednref23" title="" href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23">[23]</a>
<p>Paul VI, <em>Speech to Tibetan Buddhist Spiritual Leader</em>, Jan. 17, 1975: “The Second Vatican Council has expressed <strong>sincere admiration for Buddhism in its various forms</strong>… We wish Your Holiness and all your faithful an abundance of Prosperity and Peace.”<a id="_ednref24" title="" href="#_edn24" name="_ednref24">[24]</a></blockquote>
Notice his idolatry and apostasy in admiring, not only Buddhists, but the false religion of Buddhism.</p>
<blockquote>Paul VI, <em>Address to Buddhists</em>, June 5, 1972: “<strong>It is with great</strong> cordiality and <strong>esteem</strong> <strong>that we greet</strong> so distinguished a group of <strong>Buddhist leaders</strong> from Thailand... <strong>We have a profound regard for</strong>… <strong>your precious traditions.</strong>”<a id="_ednref25" title="" href="#_edn25" name="_ednref25">[25]</a></blockquote>
Paul VI to a group of Buddhist Leaders, June 15, 1977: “To the distinguished group of Buddhist leaders from Japan we bid a warm welcome.  <strong>The Second Vatican Council declared that the Catholic Church looks with sincere respect on your way of life</strong>… On this occasion we are happy to recall the words of St. John: ‘The world, with all it craves for, is coming to an end; but anyone who does the will of God remains forever’.”<a id="_ednref26" title="" href="#_edn26" name="_ednref26">[26]</a>
<p>He first says that the Catholic Church looks with sincere respect upon the Buddhists’ way of life.  This is heresy.  He then says that, on this occasion, he must recall the words of St. John: anyone who does the will of God remains forever.  His meaning is clearly that Buddhists will live forever; that is, they will be saved.  This is totally heretical.</p>
<blockquote>Paul VI, <em>Address to Buddhist Patriarch of Laos</em>, June 8, 1973: “… <strong>Buddhism</strong>… <strong>the Catholic Church</strong> considers its spiritual riches with esteem and respect and <strong>wishes to collaborate with you, as religious men, to bring about real peace and the salvation of man</strong>.”<a id="_ednref27" title="" href="#_edn27" name="_ednref27">[27]</a></blockquote>
Paul VI says that the Catholic Church considers with esteem the spiritual riches of the false religion of Buddhism.  He then says that he wishes to collaborate with the Buddhist Patriarch to bring about the salvation of man!  This is heresy and apostasy.<strong> </strong>
<h3 align="center"><strong>PAUL VI ON ISLAM</strong></h3>
Islam is a false religion which denies the Divinity of Christ and rejects the Most Holy Trinity.  Besides rejecting the true God, Islam allows polygamy up to four wives, and its followers (Muslims) spread this false religion with a zeal unequalled by the others.  Islam is the most viciously anti-Christian major false religion in the world.  To convert to Christianity in many Islamic countries means death.  The propagation of the true Faith is strictly prohibited by the Muslims.  Islamic society is one of the most evil things in human history.  Here is what Paul VI thought about this false religion which rejects Christ and the Trinity:
<blockquote><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Paul VI, <em>Speech</em>, Sept. 9, 1972: “We would also like you to know that the Church recognizes <strong>the riches of the Islamic faith – a faith that binds us to the one God</strong>.”<a id="_ednref28" title="" href="#_edn28" name="_ednref28">[28]</a></span></blockquote>
Paul VI speaks about the “riches” of the Islamic Faith, a “Faith” that rejects Jesus Christ and the Trinity.  He says this “Faith” binds us to the One God.  This is apostasy.
<blockquote>Paul VI, <em>Address</em>, Sept. 18, 1969: “…Moslems… along with us adore the one and merciful God, who on the last day will judge mankind.”<a id="_ednref29" title="" href="#_edn29" name="_ednref29">[29]</a></blockquote>
Moslems don’t worship the one true God, the Holy Trinity, together with Catholics, as we covered in the section on the heresies of Vatican II.  To assert that Muslims do worship the same God as Catholics is heresy.  And Moslems certainly don’t worship God who will judge mankind on the last day, Jesus Christ.
<blockquote>Paul VI, <em>Address to Muslim Ambassador</em>, June 4, 1976: “... Moroccan Moslems … our brothers in faith in the one God.  You will always be made very welcome and you will find esteem and understanding here.”<a id="_ednref30" title="" href="#_edn30" name="_ednref30">[30]</a></blockquote>
He says that Muslims are brothers in the Faith.  This is apostasy.  He then says that Muslims will always find <em>esteem</em> at the Vatican.
<blockquote>Paul VI, <em>Address</em>, Dec. 2, 1977: “…the Moslems (who) profess to hold the faith of Abraham, and together with us they adore the one, merciful God, mankind’s judge on the last day, as the Second Vatican Council solemnly declared.” <a id="_ednref31" title="" href="#_edn31" name="_ednref31">[31]</a>
<p>Paul VI, <em>Address</em>, August, 1969: “…Our lively desire to greet, in your persons, the great Moslem communities spread throughout Africa?  You thus enable Us to manifest here <strong>Our high respect for the faith you profess</strong>… In recalling the Catholic and Anglican Martyrs, <strong>We gladly recall also those confessors of the Moslem faith</strong> who were the first to suffer death…”<a id="_ednref32" title="" href="#_edn32" name="_ednref32">[32]</a></blockquote>
He mentions his high respect for the false faith of Islam, and he commemorates Muslims who witnessed to this false religion through death.  This is total apostasy.</p>
<blockquote>Paul VI, Angelus Address, Aug. 3, 1969: “<strong>Twenty-two martyrs</strong> were recognized, but there were many more, and not only Catholics.  <strong>There were also Anglicans and some Mohammedans</strong>.”<a id="_ednref33" title="" href="#_edn33" name="_ednref33">[33]</a></blockquote>
This is probably the most scandalous statement we’ve ever seen regarding the heresy that there are non-Catholic martyrs.  Paul VI says that Muslims (who don’t even believe in Christ or the Trinity) are martyrs, in addition to Anglicans.  This is truly amazing and totally heretical.
<blockquote>Pope Eugene IV, <em>Council of Florence</em>, 1441, <strong><em>ex cathedra</em></strong>: “….nobody can be saved, no matter how much he has given away in alms and even if he has shed blood in the name of Christ, unless he has persevered in the bosom and unity of the Catholic Church.”<a id="_ednref34" title="" href="#_edn34" name="_ednref34">[34]</a>
<p>Pope Eugene IV, <em>Council of Florence</em>, dogmatic Athanasian Creed, 1439: “Whoever wishes to be saved, needs above all to hold the Catholic faith; unless each one preserves this whole and inviolate, he will without a doubt perish in eternity…”<a id="_ednref35" title="" href="#_edn35" name="_ednref35">[35]</a></blockquote></p>
<h3 align="center"><strong>PAUL VI ON RELIGIOUS LIBERTY</strong></h3>
<blockquote>Paul VI, <em>Address,</em> July 9, 1969: “<strong>She [the Church] has also affirmed, during Her long history, at the cost of oppression and persecution</strong>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">freedom for everyone to profess his own religion</span>.  No one, She says, is to be restrained from acting, no one is to be forced to act in a manner contrary to his own beliefs… As we said, the Council demanded a true and public religious freedom…”<a id="_ednref36" title="" href="#_edn36" name="_ednref36">[36]</a></blockquote>
This is completely false and heretical.  The Catholic Church has affirmed during her long history, at the cost of oppression and persecution, that the religion of Jesus Christ is the only one that is true; and that Christ is truly God and truly man.  Paul VI would have us believe, however, that the martyrs were tortured horribly, not for their profession of faith in Christ, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">but in order for all to have freedom to profess their various false religions</span>!  This is an astoundingly heretical distortion of the truth!
<blockquote>Paul VI, <em>Message</em>, Dec. 10, 1973: “… the repeated violations of the sacred right to religious liberty in its various aspects and the absence of an international agreement supporting this right…”<a id="_ednref37" title="" href="#_edn37" name="_ednref37">[37]</a>
<p>Paul VI, Letter, July 25, 1975: “…the Holy See rejoices to see specifically emphasized the right of religious liberty.”<a id="_ednref38" title="" href="#_edn38" name="_ednref38">[38]</a></blockquote>
Again, in the section on Vatican II we showed that the doctrine on religious liberty which was advocated by Paul VI was, in fact, condemned by Catholic popes.</p>
<h3 align="center"><strong>PAUL VI ON THE “ORTHODOX”</strong></h3>
<p align="center"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.mostholyfamilymonastery.com/Paul_VI_pictures/Masonichandshake.jpg" alt="Anti-Pope Paul VI giving Masonic Handshake" width="218" height="191" /></p>
Here we see Paul VI giving a clear Masonic handshake to the Eastern Schismatic Patriarch of Constantinople, Athenagoras, on Jan. 5, 1964.  The two also mutually lifted the reciprocal excommunications of 1054.  Translation: this means that Paul VI considered that the Eastern "Orthodox" are no longer excommunicated even though they deny the Papacy.  Therefore, according to him, the Papacy is not a dogma binding under pain of excommunication.
<p>The Eastern Orthodox are schismatics who reject Papal Infallibility and the last 13 General Councils of the Catholic Church.  They reject that the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Second Person of the Trinity; they permit divorce and remarriage; and many of them reject the Immaculate Conception.  Here’s what Paul VI thought of these schismatics:</p>
<blockquote>Paul VI, <em>Speech</em>, April 19, 1970, speaking of the deceased schismatic Patriarch of Moscow: “<strong>To the very end he was conscious and solicitous for his great ministry</strong>.”<a id="_ednref39" title="" href="#_edn39" name="_ednref39">[39]</a></blockquote>
He says that leadership in a schismatic church is a great ministry.
<blockquote>Paul VI, <em>Address</em>, Jan. 24, 1972: “…<strong>greet among us an eminent representative of the venerable Orthodox Church… a man of great piety</strong>...” <a id="_ednref40" title="" href="#_edn40" name="_ednref40">[40]</a>
<p>Paul VI, <em>Speech</em>, Jan. 23, 1972: “…the great, venerable and excellent Orthodox Patriarch…”<a id="_ednref41" title="" href="#_edn41" name="_ednref41">[41]</a></p>
<p>Paul VI, <em>Address to Schismatic Delegation</em>, June 27, 1977: “Then, ten years later, we paid a visit to your holy Church…”<a id="_ednref42" title="" href="#_edn42" name="_ednref42">[42]</a></p>
<p>Paul VI, <em>General Audience</em>, Jan. 20, 1971: “… the venerable Eastern Orthodox Churches…”<a id="_ednref43" title="" href="#_edn43" name="_ednref43">[43]</a></blockquote>
He says that schismatic churches are venerable.</p>
<blockquote>Paul VI, speaking of the death of the Schismatic Patriarch Athenagoras, July 9, 1972: “…we recommend this great man to you, a man of a venerated Church…”<a id="_ednref44" title="" href="#_edn44" name="_ednref44">[44]</a>
<p>Paul VI, <em>Address</em>, May 25, 1968: “…the venerable Orthodox Church of Bulgaria.”<a id="_ednref45" title="" href="#_edn45" name="_ednref45">[45]</a></p>
<p>Paul VI, <em>Common Declaration with Patriarch of Syrian Schismatic Sect</em>, Oct. 27, 1971: “This should be done with love, with openness to the promptings of the Holy Spirit, and with <strong>mutual respect for each other and each other’s Church</strong>.”<a id="_ednref46" title="" href="#_edn46" name="_ednref46">[46]</a></blockquote>
So Paul VI respects the rejection of the Papacy and Papal Infallibility.</p>
<blockquote>Paul VI, <em>Telegram upon election of new Schismatic Patriarch of Constantinople</em>, July, 1972: “At the moment when you assume a heavy charge in the service of the Church of Christ…”<a id="_ednref47" title="" href="#_edn47" name="_ednref47">[47]</a></blockquote>
This means that the schismatic Church is the Church of Christ.
<blockquote>Paul VI, <em>Address</em>, Dec. 14, 1976: “…very dear Brothers, sent by the venerable Church of Constantinople… <strong>we carried out the solemn and sacred ecclesial act of lifting the ancient anathemas</strong>, an act with which we wished to remove the memory of these events forever from the memory and the heart of the Church…”<a id="_ednref48" title="" href="#_edn48" name="_ednref48">[48]</a></blockquote>
The schismatic “Orthodox” are anathematized by the Catholic Church for denying the Papacy, and not accepting dogmas of the Catholic Faith.  But Paul VI solemnly lifted these anathemas against them, as we mentioned above.  Like the statement above, this address of Paul VI means he attempted to overturn the Papacy as a dogma which must be believed under pain of anathema or condemnation.
<blockquote>Paul VI, <em>Letter</em>, March 7, 1971, regarding the death of two schismatic patriarchs: “…moved by the death of His Holiness Patriarch Kyrillos VI we express our sincere sympathy with assurance of <strong>our prayers for the eternal repose of your beloved pastor</strong> and <strong>for God’s consoling blessing on the entire Coptic Orthodox Church</strong>.”<a id="_ednref49" title="" href="#_edn49" name="_ednref49">[49]</a></blockquote>
Notice two things: First, Paul VI says that he will pray for the soul of the deceased schismatic, indicating that the deceased non-Catholic patriarch can be saved, which is heretical.  Second, he calls for God’s consoling blessing on the entire Coptic Orthodox Church.  How about that there is only one true Church and that the Coptic Schismatic Church is not part of it?  How about God’s grace of conversion for the Coptic Orthodox to the true Church?  Paul VI’s statement shows again that he held heretical sects to be true Churches, and the Catholic Faith to be meaningless.
<blockquote>Pope Gregory XVI, May 27, 1832: “Be not deceived, my brother; if anyone follows a schismatic, he will not attain the inheritance of the kingdom of God.”<a id="_ednref50" title="" href="#_edn50" name="_ednref50">[50]</a>
<p>Paul VI, <em>Letter to Schismatic</em>, November, 1976: “…the first Pan-Orthodox Conference in preparation for <strong>the Great Holy Council of the Orthodox Churches</strong> is beginning its work… for the best service of <strong>the venerable Orthodox Church</strong>.”<a id="_ednref51" title="" href="#_edn51" name="_ednref51">[51]</a></blockquote>
He calls the schismatic council “holy” and the schismatic Church “venerable.”  Paul VI was a schismatic.</p>
<blockquote>Paul VI, <em>General Audience</em>, Jan. 24, 1973: “…<strong>our brother of venerated memory</strong>, the ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople…”<a id="_ednref52" title="" href="#_edn52" name="_ednref52">[52]</a>
<p>Paul VI, <em>Message concerning deceased Russian schismatic</em>, April 7, 1972: “…we express to Your Eminence and the Holy Synod of the Georgian Orthodox Church our sincere condolences <strong>with the assurance of our prayers for the eternal repose of your pastor</strong>…”<a id="_ednref53" title="" href="#_edn53" name="_ednref53">[53]</a></p>
<p>Paul VI, <em>Message</em>, May 23, 1968, <strong>to the Schismatic Patriarch of Moscow</strong>: “…<strong>Holiness</strong>, on the occasion of the celebrations for the fiftieth anniversary for the day when the Synod of the whole Orthodox Church of Russia re-established the Patriarchal See of Moscow… we have delegated to participate in the solemn celebrations which will take place in your Patriarchal City <strong>our very dear brothers in the Episcopate</strong>…”<a id="_ednref54" title="" href="#_edn54" name="_ednref54">[54]</a></blockquote>
He calls the schismatic Patriarch “Holiness” and celebrates the fiftieth anniversary of the schismatic Church.</p>
<blockquote>Paul VI, <em>Speech to Schismatic</em>, July 1, 1978: “We receive you with affection and <em>esteem</em>.”<a id="_ednref55" title="" href="#_edn55" name="_ednref55">[55]</a>
<p>Paul VI, <em>General Audience</em>, Nov. 30, 1977: “We greet you joyfully, <strong>beloved brothers, who represent here His Holiness</strong> Patriarch Pimen and <strong>the Russian Orthodox Church</strong>… <strong>all our esteem </strong>and brotherly love<strong> to His Holiness Patriarch Pimen, to his clergy and to the whole people of the faithful</strong>.”<a id="_ednref56" title="" href="#_edn56" name="_ednref56">[56]</a></p>
<p>Paul VI went on to say in a letter about the schismatic Athenagoras (July, 1972): “…we pray the Lord to receive into His heavenly kingdom him…”<a id="_ednref57" title="" href="#_edn57" name="_ednref57">[57]</a></p>
<p>Paul VI, <em>Joint Declaration with the Schismatic “Pope” Shenouda III</em>, May 10, 1973: “Paul VI, Bishop of Rome and Pope of the Catholic Church, and <strong>Shenouda III, Pope of Alexandria and Patriarch of the See of St. Mark</strong>… In the name of this charity, <strong>we reject all forms of proselytism… Let it cease, where it may exist</strong>…”<a id="_ednref58" title="" href="#_edn58" name="_ednref58">[58]</a></blockquote>
This is all one really needs to see to know that Paul VI was a schismatic and not a Catholic.  He makes a Joint Declaration with a schismatic “pope.”  He acknowledges this schismatic as the holder of the See of St. Mark.  This is a blasphemy against the Papacy, since this schismatic holds no authority whatsoever.  He rejects all forms of proselytism – that is, trying to convert the schismatics – and he says “let it cease where it may exist”!  Paul VI was a formal heretic and schismatic.</p>
<h3 align="center"><strong>PAUL VI ON OTHER PROTESTANT SECTS</strong></h3>
Protestantism began with the German priest Martin Luther, who left the Catholic Church and started the Protestant revolution in 1517.  Luther denied free will, the Papacy, praying to the saints, Purgatory, Tradition, Transubstantiation and the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass.  Luther replaced the Mass with a memorial service commemorating the Last Supper.  All the sacraments except Baptism and the Holy Eucharist were rejected.  Luther held that after the fall of Adam man cannot produce any good works.  Most Protestants hold the same beliefs as Luther, but all of them reject numerous Catholic dogmas.  Here’s what Paul VI thought of these heretics and schismatics:
<blockquote>Paul VI, <em>Angelus Address</em>, Jan. 17, 1971: “From polemical opposition among the various Christian denominations we have passed to mutual respect…”<a id="_ednref59" title="" href="#_edn59" name="_ednref59">[59]</a></blockquote>
Here Paul VI reveals that the Vatican II agenda with regard to Protestant sects has gone from polemical opposition – in other words, an opposition to their false doctrines – to an attitude of acceptance of, and mutual respect for, their false religion.
<blockquote>Paul VI, <em>Speech to Representatives of non-Catholic churches in Geneva</em>, June, 1969: “The spirit that animates us… This spirit lays down, as the first basis of every fruitful contact between different confessions, <strong>that each profess his faith loyally</strong>.”<a id="_ednref60" title="" href="#_edn60" name="_ednref60">[60]</a></blockquote>
Paul VI is saying that the Protestants should not become Catholic, but remain loyal to their own sects.
<blockquote>Paul VI, <em>Homily</em>, Jan. 25, 1973: “…express a respectful and affectionate thought in Christ to Christians of other denominations residing in this city and assure them of our <strong>esteem</strong>…”<a id="_ednref61" title="" href="#_edn61" name="_ednref61">[61]</a></blockquote>
This is an incredible homily.  In it he’s assuring the heretics of other denominations of his <em>esteem.</em>  Consider that Paul VI didn’t even personally know all the people he was esteeming.  He didn’t know anything about them <span style="text-decoration: underline;">except that they belong to one of these sects</span>, and he assured them of his esteem <em>on that basis</em>!
<blockquote>Paul VI, <em>Letter</em>, Aug. 6, 1973, to the World Council of Churches: “<strong>The World Council of Churches has been created in order</strong>, by the grace of God, to serve the Churches and Ecclesial Communities in their endeavors <strong>to restore and to manifest to all that perfect communion in faith and love which is the gift of Christ to His Church</strong>.”<a id="_ednref62" title="" href="#_edn62" name="_ednref62">[62]</a></blockquote>
Paul VI says that the World Council of Churches has been created to restore and to manifest to all that perfect communion in faith and love which is the gift of Christ to His Church.  Notice the astounding implication of this statement.  The perfect communion in faith and charity which is the gift of Christ to His Church is the organization of the Catholic Church, the universal Church founded by Christ.  <strong>But Paul VI says that this is manifested by the World Council of Churches!</strong>  He has replaced the Catholic Church with the World Council of Churches.  The World Council of Churches is an organization made up of many different sects and denominations.  A traditional commentator would correctly label it a Communist front group – meant to water-down and liberalize the “Christian” churches of the world.  But it is undoubtedly a very heretical ecumenical organization made of various man-made religions.
<blockquote>Paul VI, Discourse, Dec. 12, 1968: “…our sons are on friendly terms with their Christian brothers, Lutheran Evangelicals…”<a id="_ednref63" title="" href="#_edn63" name="_ednref63">[63]</a>
<p>Pope Pius IV, profession of faith, <em>Council of Trent</em>, ex cathedra: <strong><em>“</em></strong>This true Catholic faith, outside of which no one can be saved… I now profess and truly hold…”<a id="_ednref64" title="" href="#_edn64" name="_ednref64">[64]</a></p>
<p>Paul VI, <em>Address,</em> April 28, 1977: “…relations between the Catholic Church and the Anglican Communion… <strong>these words of hope, ‘The Anglican Communion united not absorbed,’ are no longer a mere dream</strong>.”<a id="_ednref65" title="" href="#_edn65" name="_ednref65">[65]</a></blockquote>
This means that Paul VI <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">wants to unite with the Anglican sect without absorbing them; that is, without converting them</span></strong>.<strong>
</strong></p>
<blockquote>Paul VI, <em>Speech</em>, Aug. 2, 1969: “We wished to meet the Anglican Church which flourishes in this country.  We wished to pay homage to those sons of whom it is most proud, those who – together with our own Catholic martyrs – gave the generous witness of their lives to the Gospel...”<a id="_ednref66" title="" href="#_edn66" name="_ednref66">[66]</a>
<p>Paul VI, Speaking of the death of the Protestant Martin Luther King, Jr., April 7, 1968: “…we shall all share the hopes which his martyrdom inspires in us.”<a id="_ednref67" title="" href="#_edn67" name="_ednref67">[67]</a></p>
<p>Pope Gregory XVI, May 27, 1832: “Finally some of these misguided people attempt to persuade themselves and others that men are not saved only in the Catholic religion, but that even heretics may attain eternal life.”<a id="_ednref68" title="" href="#_edn68" name="_ednref68">[68]</a><strong> </strong></blockquote></p>
<h3 align="center"><strong>PAUL VI ON BIRTH CONTROL</strong></h3>
Paul VI favored birth control.
<blockquote>Paul VI, <em>Speech</em>, Nov. 16, 1970: “…this, among other effects, will undoubtedly favor <strong>a rational control of birth by couples</strong>…”<a id="_ednref69" title="" href="#_edn69" name="_ednref69">[69]</a>
<p>Paul VI, Address, Aug. 24, 1969: “…the liberty of husband and wife and does not forbid them a moral and reasonable <strong>limitation of birth</strong>…”<a id="_ednref70" title="" href="#_edn70" name="_ednref70">[70]</a></p>
<p>Paul VI, <em>Humanae Vitae</em> (No. 16), July 25, 1968: “It cannot be denied that in each case the married couple, for acceptable reasons, are both perfectly clear in their intention to avoid children and wish to make sure that none will result.”<a id="_ednref71" title="" href="#_edn71" name="_ednref71">[71]</a></blockquote>
Paul VI says in <em>Humanae Vitae</em> that couples are perfectly free to have zero children if they want to.<strong> </strong></p>
<h3 align="center"><strong>PAUL VI ON THE UNITED NATIONS</strong></h3>
The United Nations is an evil organization that promotes contraception and abortion, and looks to take control of the decision-making for every country on the planet.  Former UN Secretary General U Thant praised the Communist Lenin as a man whose “ideals were reflected in the United Nations Charter.”<a id="_ednref72" title="" href="#_edn72" name="_ednref72">[72]</a>  Here’s what Paul VI thought of the UN:
<blockquote>Paul VI, <em>Address</em>, Feb. 5, 1972: “…<strong>we have faith in the UN</strong>.”<a id="_ednref73" title="" href="#_edn73" name="_ednref73">[73]</a>
<p>Paul VI, <em>Message</em>, April 26, 1968: “…may all men of heart join together peacefully in order <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">that the principles of the United Nations may be not only proclaimed, but put into effect</span></strong>, and that not only the constitution of States may promulgate them, but public authorities apply them…”<a id="_ednref74" title="" href="#_edn74" name="_ednref74">[74]</a></p>
<p>Paul VI, <em>Address to Secretary General of the U.N.</em>, July 9, 1977: “We wish to listen to the voice of the authorized representative of the United Nations Organization… all this merely emphasizes more the beneficial and <strong>irreplaceable role of the United Nations Organization</strong>…”<a id="_ednref75" title="" href="#_edn75" name="_ednref75">[75]</a></p>
<p>Paul VI, <em>Message to U.N</em>., Oct. 4, 1970: “Today we wish once more to repeat the words which we had the honor to pronounce on 4th October 1965 from the tribune of your assembly: ‘<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This Organization represents the path that has to be taken for modern civilization and for world peace</span></strong>…  Where else, moreover, could these governments and peoples better find a bridge to link them, a table round which they can gather, and a tribunal where they may plead the cause of justice and peace?&hellip; <strong>who better than the United Nations Organization and its specialized agencies will be able to take up the challenge presented to all mankind?&hellip; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">There exists in effect a common good of man, and it is up to your Organization, because of its dedication to universality</span>, which is its reason for being, to promote it untiringly.”<a id="_ednref76" title="" href="#_edn76" name="_ednref76"><strong>[76]</strong></a></strong></blockquote>
First, Paul VI says that the U.N. is the path that has to be taken.  He says that the U.N., not the Catholic Church, is the best means for the cause of justice and peace for the world.  Second, he says that the U.N. is the universal (that is, <em>Catholic</em>) body for mankind!  He is replacing the Church with the UN.</p>
<h3 align="center"><strong>PAUL VI PROMOTING THE NEW WORLD ORDER</strong></h3>
<blockquote>Paul VI, <em>Message to President of a U.N. Conference</em>, May, 1976: “…<strong>this new international economic order that has to be ceaselessly built up.</strong>”<a id="_ednref77" title="" href="#_edn77" name="_ednref77">[77]</a>
<p>Paul VI, <em>Message</em>, Sept. 8, 1977: “Stress is legitimately laid nowadays on the necessity of <strong>constructing a new world order</strong>&hellip;”<a id="_ednref78" title="" href="#_edn78" name="_ednref78">[78]</a></p>
<p>Paul VI, <em>Message to United Nations</em>, May 24, 1978: “…we are aware that the path which must lead to the coming of a new international order… cannot in any case be as short as we would like it to be… <strong>Disarmament, a new world order</strong> and development are three obligations that are inseparably bound together…”<a id="_ednref79" title="" href="#_edn79" name="_ednref79">[79]</a><strong> </strong><strong> </strong></blockquote></p>
<h3 align="center"><strong>PAUL VI ON THE WORSHIP OF MAN</strong></h3>
<blockquote>Paul VI, <em>Address</em>, Feb. 7, 1971: “All honor then to man!”<a id="_ednref80" title="" href="#_edn80" name="_ednref80">[80]</a>
<p>Paul VI, <em>Address</em>, Aug. 1, 1969: “…do not let yourselves become discouraged by the obstacles and difficulties that constantly arise; <strong>do not lose faith in man</strong>.”<a id="_ednref81" title="" href="#_edn81" name="_ednref81">[81]</a></p>
<p>Paul VI, <em>Message</em>, March 25, 1971: “…man, to whom all things on earth should be related as their center and crown.”<a id="_ednref82" title="" href="#_edn82" name="_ednref82">[82]</a></blockquote>
This is blasphemy.  Paul VI was quoting the heresy of Vatican II here.</p>
<blockquote>Paul VI, <em>Speech</em>, Nov. 18, 1971: “On our visit to Bombay we emphasized: ‘Man must meet man.’”<a id="_ednref83" title="" href="#_edn83" name="_ednref83">[83]</a></blockquote>
Paul VI, <em>Audience</em>, Jan. 10, 1972: “For the demands of justice, Gentlemen, can only be gathered in the light of truth, that truth which is man…”<a id="_ednref84" title="" href="#_edn84" name="_ednref84">[84]</a>
<p>This means that man is the truth.</p>
<blockquote>Paul VI, <em>Address</em>, April 11, 1973: “…always anxious to safeguard, above everything else, the primacy of man…”<a id="_ednref85" title="" href="#_edn85" name="_ednref85">[85]</a>
<p>In his <em>Angelus Address</em>, Jan. 27, 1974, Paul VI spoke positively of: “…the cult of man for man’s sake.”<a id="_ednref86" title="" href="#_edn86" name="_ednref86">[86]</a></p>
<p>Paul VI, <em>Address</em>, Feb. 15, 1974: “…as Your Excellency has rightly recalled – that the final aim is man…”<a id="_ednref87" title="" href="#_edn87" name="_ednref87">[87]</a></p>

<p>Paul VI, <em>Angelus Address</em>, July 20, 1969: “We would do well to meditate on man…”<a id="_ednref90" title="" href="#_edn90" name="_ednref90">[90]</a></p>
<p>Paul VI, <em>General Audience</em>, July 28, 1971: “The dignity of man!  We will never be able to appreciate and honor it enough.”<a id="_ednref91" title="" href="#_edn91" name="_ednref91">[91]</a></p>
<p>Paul VI, <em>Discourse</em>, Sept. 4, 1968: “…the themes which today pre-occupy religion, be it Catholic or non-Catholic, <strong>all these converge from different directions upon one central, dominant focus, namely: man</strong>.  ‘According to the almost unanimous opinion of believers and unbelievers alike, all things on earth should be related to man as their center and crown.’”<a id="_ednref92" title="" href="#_edn92" name="_ednref92">[92]</a></p>
<p>Paul VI, <em>Angelus Message</em>, July 13, 1975: “…the most precious science of all, the science of knowing oneself, of reflecting, almost dreaming, about one’s own conscience… Long live the holiday free of other commitments, but occupied in exploring the secrets of one’s own life.”<a id="_ednref93" title="" href="#_edn93" name="_ednref93">[93]</a></blockquote>
Think about this astounding message.  He doesn’t say that theology, the study of God, is the most precious science; he says it is the science of knowing oneself and dreaming about one’s own conscience.  He also says long live the holiday (that is, long live the holy day) free of other commitments (perhaps free of attending Mass?), a holy day occupied in exploring the secrets of one’s own life.  In other words, he wants a holy day about man with no other commitments.  This is clearly the worship of man.</p>
<blockquote>Paul VI, <em>Angelus Message</em>, Sept. 26, 1976: “We are in ecstasy of admiration for the human countenance…”<a id="_ednref94" title="" href="#_edn94" name="_ednref94">[94]</a>
<p>Paul VI, <em>Address</em>, Oct. 16, 1976: “…if the Gospel is for man, we Christians are completely for the Gospel.”<a id="_ednref95" title="" href="#_edn95" name="_ednref95">[95]</a></blockquote>
Notice that he only says that we are for the Gospel if the Gospel is for man.</p>
<blockquote>Paul VI, <em>Address</em>, Dec. 4, 1976: “…above all ideological conditionings, the greatness and dignity of the human person must emerge as the only value to promote and defend.”<a id="_ednref96" title="" href="#_edn96" name="_ednref96">[96]</a>
<p>Paul VI, <em>Christmas Message</em>, Dec. 25, 1976: “Let us honor fallen and sinful humanity.”<a id="_ednref97" title="" href="#_edn97" name="_ednref97">[97]</a></p>
<p>Paul VI, <em>Speech</em>, June 10, 1969: “For in the final analysis there is no true riches but the riches of man.”<a id="_ednref98" title="" href="#_edn98" name="_ednref98">[98]</a></blockquote></p>
<h3 align="center"><strong>PAUL VI ON CHRISTMAS</strong></h3>
<blockquote>Paul VI, <em>General Audience</em>, Dec. 17, 1969: “…Christmas is the birthday of Life.  Of our life.”<a id="_ednref99" title="" href="#_edn99" name="_ednref99">[99]</a></blockquote>
Christmas is the Birthday of Jesus Christ.  It’s not the Birthday of our life because we are not Jesus Christ.  But this is what Paul VI was preaching.
<blockquote>Paul VI, <em>Angelus Address</em>, Dec. 21, 1974: “A merry Christmas to you… It is the feast of human life…”<a id="_ednref100" title="" href="#_edn100" name="_ednref100">[100]</a>
<p>Paul VI, <em>Christmas Message</em>, Dec. 25, 1976: “Brethren, let us honor in the Birth of Christ the incipient life of man.”<a id="_ednref101" title="" href="#_edn101" name="_ednref101">[101]</a></blockquote>
The word <em>incipient</em> means “Beginning; in an initial stage.”<a id="_ednref102" title="" href="#_edn102" name="_ednref102">[102]</a>  So, Paul VI is saying that in the Birth of Christ we find in the beginning stages of the life of man.  This implies, once again, that man is Christ.</p>
<blockquote>Paul VI, <em>Angelus Message</em>, Dec. 18, 1976: “Christmas is a feast of mankind… dedicated, as a happy effect, to honor human existence.”<a id="_ednref103" title="" href="#_edn103" name="_ednref103">[103]</a>
<p>Paul VI, <em>Speech</em>, Sept. 12, 1970: “…the only word which explains Man is God himself made Man, the Word made Flesh.”<a id="_ednref104" title="" href="#_edn104" name="_ednref104">[104]</a></blockquote>
This clearly means that man is God Himself made man, Our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<blockquote>Pope Pius X, <em>E Supremi Apostolatus,</em> Oct. 4, 1903: “…<strong>the distinguishing mark of Antichrist, man has with infinite temerity put himself in the place of God…</strong>”<a id="_ednref105" title="" href="#_edn105" name="_ednref105">[105]</a></blockquote>
Paul VI was a manifest heretic and a non-Catholic antipope.
<h3 align="center"><strong>OTHER CHANGES MADE BY PAUL VI</strong></h3>
<p align="center"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.mostholyfamilymonastery.com/Paul_VI_pictures/givingawaytiara.jpg" alt="Anti-Pope Paul VI giving away the Papal Tiara" width="260" height="358" /></p>
<p align="center">Paul VI giving away the Papal Tiara</p>
On November 13, 1964, Paul VI gave away the triple-crowned papal tiara.  Paul VI had the tiara auctioned at the New York World’s Fair.<a id="_ednref106" title="" href="#_edn106" name="_ednref106">[106]</a>  <strong>The Papal Tiara is a sign of a true Pope’s authority</strong> – the three crowns representing the dogmatic, liturgical and disciplinary authority of a pope.  By giving it away, Paul VI was symbolically giving away the authority of the Papacy (although he had none to give away since he was actually an antipope).  But <strong>it was a symbolic act of how he was a satanic infiltrator whose whole mission was to attempt to destroy the Catholic Church</strong>.

<h2 align="center"><strong>PAUL VI WAS ALSO SEEN MANY TIMES WEARING THE BREAST-PLATE OF THE EPHOD, A.K.A., THE RATIONAL OF JUDGMENT OF A JEWISH HIGH-PRIEST</strong></h2>

<p align="center">Paul VI wearing the breastplate of the ephod, a vestment used by Freemasons and Jewish High-Priests</p>
Notice t<strong>he twelve stones which represent the twelve tribes of Israel.</strong><strong>   <strong>Not only is this the breast-plate of a Jewish High-Priest, but according to the </strong><em>Encyclopedia of Freemasonry</em><strong> by Mackey, the ephod is also "worn in the (Masonic) American Chapters of the Royal Arch, by the High-Priest as an official part of his official ornaments.”  </strong></strong>The ephod was the vestment that was worn by Caiphas, the High-Priest of the Jewish religion, who ordered Our Lord Jesus Christ to be put to death by crucifixion.
<p><strong>Antipope Paul VI wore the breast-plate of the Ephod, a.k.a. the Rational of Judgment of the High-Priest, numerous times.  </strong>God allows things such as this to come out to show the people that these men are infiltrators and enemies of the Catholic Church.</p>
<p>In addition to all of the heresies we have covered in the speeches of Paul VI, he was the man who authoritatively implemented the false Second Vatican Council, changed the Catholic Mass into a Protestant service, and changed the rite of every single Sacrament.  He changed the matter or form of the Eucharist, Extreme Unction, Holy Orders, and Confirmation.  Paul VI wanted to put Christ to death in the Mass (by removing it and replacing it with a counterfeit), and wanted to kill His Catholic Church by attempting to change the Church completely.</p>
<p>Within two years of the close of Vatican II, Paul VI removed the index of forbidden books, a decision one commentator rightly called “incomprehensible.”</p>

<p align="center">Another shot of Paul VI wearing the breastplate of the ephod</p>
Paul VI then abolished the oath against Modernism, at a time when Modernism was flourishing as never before.  On Nov. 21, 1970,<a id="_ednref107" title="" href="#_edn107" name="_ednref107">[107]</a> Paul VI also excluded all cardinals over 80 years of age from participating in papal elections.  Paul VI disestablished the papal court, disbanded the Noble Guard and the Palatine Guards.<a id="_ednref108" title="" href="#_edn108" name="_ednref108">[108]</a>  Paul VI abolished the rite of Tonsure, all four Minor Orders, and the rank of Subdiaconate.<a id="_ednref109" title="" href="#_edn109" name="_ednref109">[109]</a>
<blockquote>“<strong>Paul VI gave back to the Muslims the Standard of Lepanto</strong>.  The history of the flag was venerable.  It was taken from a Turkish admiral during a great naval battle in 1571.  While Pope St. Pius V fasted and prayed the Rosary, an out-numbered Christian fleet defeated a much larger Moslem navy, thus saving Christendom from the infidel.  In honor of the miraculous victory, Pius V instituted the Feast of Our Lady of the Most Holy Rosary to commemorate her intercession.  <strong>In one dramatic act, Paul VI renounced not only a remarkable Christian victory, but the prayers and sacrifices of a great pope and saint.</strong>”<a id="_ednref110" title="" href="#_edn110" name="_ednref110">[110]</a></blockquote>
Under Paul VI, the Holy Office was reformed: its primary function now was research, not defending the Catholic Faith.<a id="_ednref111" title="" href="#_edn111" name="_ednref111">[111]</a>  According to those who watched film of Paul VI’s visit to Fatima, he did not pray one Hail Mary.<a id="_ednref112" title="" href="#_edn112" name="_ednref112">[112]</a>
<p>In 1969, Paul VI removed forty saints from the official liturgical calendar.<a id="_ednref113" title="" href="#_edn113" name="_ednref113">[113]</a></p>
<p>Paul VI removed solemn exorcisms from the baptismal rite.  In the place of the solemn exorcisms, he substituted an optional prayer that makes only a passing reference to fighting the Devil.<a id="_ednref114" title="" href="#_edn114" name="_ednref114">[114]</a></p>
<p align="center"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.mostholyfamilymonastery.com/Paul_VI_pictures/P6ephod.jpg" alt="Anti-Pope Paul VI breastplate ephod Jewish High Priest" width="269" height="488" /></p>
<p align="center">Another clear shot of Paul VI wearing the breastplate of the ephod</p>
Paul VI granted more than 32,000 requests from priests who had asked to be released from their vows and returned to lay status – the greatest exodus from the priesthood since the Protestant revolution.<a id="_ednref115" title="" href="#_edn115" name="_ednref115">[115]</a>
<p>Paul VI&rsquo;s disastrous influence was visible immediately.  For example, in Holland not a single candidate applied for admission to the priesthood in 1970, and within 12 months every seminary there was closed.<a id="_ednref116" title="" href="#_edn116" name="_ednref116">[116]</a>  Spiritual destruction was everywhere; countless millions left the Church; countless others ceased practicing their Faith and confessing their sins.</p>
<p>And while Paul VI was the cause of this unrelenting disaster and spiritual destruction, like the sly serpent he was, he calculatingly misdirected the attention away from himself.  In perhaps his most famous quotation, he noted that Satan’s smoke had made its way into the Temple of God.</p>
<blockquote>Paul VI, <em>Homily</em>, June 29, 1972: “<strong>Satan’s smoke has made its way into the Temple of God through some crack</strong>…”<a id="_ednref117" title="" href="#_edn117" name="_ednref117">[117]</a></blockquote>
When Paul VI made this statement, everyone looked at the cardinals, the bishops and the priests to discover where this smoke of Satan might be.  They looked at everyone except the man who made the statement.  But Paul VI was actually the smoke of Satan, and he made the statement to misdirect people away from himself; and in this he was successful.  But what is perhaps most frightening is that Paul VI’s famous statement is basically a direct reference to Apocalypse 9:1-3.
<blockquote>Apoc. 9:1-3: “And there was given to him the key of the bottomless pit.  And he opened the bottomless pit: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and the smoke of the pit arose</span>, as the smoke of a great furnace…”</blockquote>
In Apocalypse 9, we see a direct reference to the smoke of Satan, and to someone who is given the key to unleash it.  Antipope Paul VI did not have the keys of Peter, but he was given the key to the bottomless pit.  He was the one who brought in the smoke of Satan from the great furnace; as he says, from some crack.
<blockquote>Jean Guitton, an intimate friend of Paul VI, related what Paul VI said at the final session of Vatican II: “It was the final session of the Council,” Guitton wrote, “the most essential, in which Paul VI was to bestow on all humanity the teachings of the Council.  He announced this to me on that day with these words, ‘<strong>I am about to blow the seven trumpets of the Apocalypse</strong>.’”<a id="_ednref118" title="" href="#_edn118" name="_ednref118">[118]</a>
<p>Paul VI, <em>Speech to Lombard Seminary</em>, Dec. 7, 1968: “The Church finds herself in an hour of disquiet, of self-criticism,<strong> one might say even of self-destruction</strong>… <strong>The Church is wounding herself</strong>.”<a id="_ednref119" title="" href="#_edn119" name="_ednref119">[119]</a></blockquote>
Here Paul VI again mocks the people.  He says the Church is in “self-destruction” and is “wounding herself.”  He is referring to himself again, for <em>he </em>was the one trying to destroy her and wound her at every turn!</p>
<h3 align="center"><strong>PAUL VI ON “MAGIC”</strong></h3>
<blockquote><em>The Oxford Illustrated Dictionary</em> defines magic as: “Pretended art of influencing events by occult control of nature or of spirits, witchcraft…”<a id="_ednref120" title="" href="#_edn120" name="_ednref120">[120]</a></blockquote>
Catholics are forbidden to practice magic.  But Paul VI frequently spoke of magic.
<blockquote>Paul VI, <em>Homily</em>, Nov. 12, 1972: “Where does it come from, this <strong>interior</strong> <strong>magic </strong>that banishes fear…”<a id="_ednref121" title="" href="#_edn121" name="_ednref121">[121]</a>
<p>Paul VI, <em>General Audience</em>, Dec. 30, 1970: “…<strong>invisible but overpowering</strong> <strong>magic</strong> of the flood of public opinion…”<a id="_ednref122" title="" href="#_edn122" name="_ednref122">[122]</a></p>
<p>Paul VI, <em>Message</em>, Jan. 1, 1975: “Reconciliation!&hellip; Could not <strong>this magic word</strong> find a place in the dictionary of your hopes…”<a id="_ednref123" title="" href="#_edn123" name="_ednref123">[123]</a></p>
<p>Paul VI, <em>Homily</em>, May 11, 1975: “You, artists of the theatre and the cinema… who possess <strong>the magic art</strong> of offering with voice and with music… the real-life scene of the event…”<a id="_ednref124" title="" href="#_edn124" name="_ednref124">[124]</a></p>
<p>Paul VI, <em>Speech</em>, May 18, 1969: “Everything is transformed under <strong>the</strong> <strong>magical</strong> <strong>influence</strong> of science…”<a id="_ednref125" title="" href="#_edn125" name="_ednref125">[125]</a></p>
<p>Paul VI, <em>Message to Brazilian People</em>, February, 1972: “Service: <strong>a magic word</strong> that galvanizes into action…”<a id="_ednref126" title="" href="#_edn126" name="_ednref126">[126]</a></p>
<p>Paul VI, <em>Address</em>, June 23, 1973: “…the religious root seems to have lost so much of its <strong>magical</strong> <strong>power</strong> of inspiration?”<a id="_ednref127" title="" href="#_edn127" name="_ednref127">[127]</a></blockquote>
Why did Paul VI speak so much about magic?  It was, in our opinion, precisely because he knew that it was Black Magic that allowed him, a satanic infiltrator, to fool the world into thinking that he was a pope so he could then destroy the Mass and almost the entire Catholic Church.  He knew that it was his Black Magic that allowed him to get away with changing the rite to every sacrament and foisting his new Vatican II religion upon the world.</p>
<h3 align="center"><strong>PAUL VI ADMITTED HIS CHURCH IS THE WHORE OF BABYLON</strong></h3>
In the Apocalypse, chapters 17 and 18, there is predicted that a whore will arise in the last days from the city of seven hills, which is Rome.  This whore will tread upon the blood of the martyrs and saints.  This whore is clearly contrasted with the immaculate bride of Christ, the Catholic Church.  In other words, the whore of Babylon will be a false church from Rome that will appear in the last days.  Near the end of this book we bring forward the evidence that the Whore of Babylon is the Vatican II sect, a false bride which arises in Rome in the last days in order to deceive the Catholic Faithful.
<blockquote>In her appearance at La Salette, France, Sept. 19, 1846, the Blessed Mother predicted: <strong>“Rome will lose the Faith and become the seat of the Anti-Christ… the Church will be in eclipse.”</strong></blockquote>
In the following quote, Antipope Paul VI essentially admits that his new Church is this false Church by admitting that his “Church” has thrown off its opposition to the world, which characterizes the true Church.
<blockquote>Paul VI, <em>General Audience</em>, Oct. 1, 1969: “On the other hand, She [the Church] is also trying to adapt herself and assimilate herself to the world’s ways; She is taking off her distinctive sacral garment, for She wants to feel more human and earthly.
<p>“She is tending to let herself be absorbed by the social and temporal milieu.  She has almost been seized by human respect at the thought that She is different in some way and obliged to have a style of thought and life which is not that of the world.  <strong>She is undergoing the world’s changes and degradations with conformist, almost <em>avante-garde</em> zeal</strong>.”<a id="_ednref128" title="" href="#_edn128" name="_ednref128">[128]</a></blockquote>
Here Paul VI admits that the post-Vatican II Church is a false Church which has adapted itself to the world and assimilated the world’s ways with zeal.  This is a stunning admission by Paul VI.  He is admitting in so many words that the post-Vatican II Church is the Whore of Babylon.</p>
<p><strong>When one combines the fact that Paul VI frequently wore the Jewish Ephod with all of his other systematic attempts to destroy all of Catholic Tradition, the evidence is strong that he was a satanic Jewish infiltrator.</strong></p>
<p>In fact, Paul VI’s ancestors were of Jewish origin.  His actual name was Giovanni Montini.  The Montini family is listed in the <em>Golden Book of Noble Italian Heritage</em> (1962-1964, p. 994): “A branch of the… noble family from Brescia… wherefrom their noble blazon comes and which avows as its sure trunk and founder, a Bartholomew (Bartolino) de Benedictis, said <strong>Montini was of Hebrew origin</strong>.<a id="_ednref129" title="" href="#_edn129" name="_ednref129">[129]</a></p>
<h3 align="center"><strong>ANOTHER PICTURE OF ANTIPOPE PAUL VI WEARING THE RATIONAL OF A JEWISH HIGH-PRIEST</strong></h3>
<p align="center"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.mostholyfamilymonastery.com/Paul_VI_pictures/Paul_VI2ephod.jpg" alt="" width="228" height="461" /></p>
We have proven that Paul VI was a complete apostate who believed that false religions are true, that heresy and schism are fine, and that schismatics should not be converted, just to name a few.
<p>If you accept <a title="The Heresies in Vatican Council II" href="https://vaticancatholic.com/vatican-ii-council/">Vatican II</a> or the <a title="The Invalid New Mass" href="https://vaticancatholic.com/new-mass-traditional-latin-mass/">New Mass</a> or the new sacramental rites – in short, if you accept the Vatican II religion – this is the man whose religion you are following, a manifestly heretical infiltrator, whose whole mission was to attempt to overturn and destroy as much of the Catholic Faith as possible.</p>
<p>Catholics must have no part with Antipope Paul VI’s New Mass (the Novus Ordo) and must completely reject Vatican II and the new sacramental rites.  Catholics must completely reject Antipope Paul VI for the non-Catholic antipope he was.  Catholics must reject and not support any group which accepts this apostate as a valid pope, or which accepts the New Mass or Vatican II or the new sacramental rites of Paul VI.</p>

Here is a picture of Antipope Paul VI's signature.  If you turn it upside-down, you see that there are three clear 6's.  The shot below is a close-up of his name turned upside-down.  The three 6's are clear.  As far as we know, this is the way that Paul VI's signature always appeared.
