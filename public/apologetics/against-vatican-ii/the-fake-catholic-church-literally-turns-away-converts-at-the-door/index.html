<p>We’ve already documented that Paul VI, John Paul II and Benedict XVI explicitly taught/teach that non-Catholics, such as the Protestants and Eastern Orthodox, don’t need to be converted to the Catholic Faith for unity and salvation.&nbsp; In keeping with this heretical theology, Vatican officials have actively turned away non-Catholics who have presented themselves for conversion to the Catholic Faith!</p>

<p>The Vatican officials told him that he must not become Catholic!&nbsp; They were just following the evil policy taught by the Vatican II antipopes, Paul VI, John Paul II and Benedict XVI.</p>
<p>In 2005, we were contacted by an Eastern Orthodox bishop who was interested in converting to Catholicism.&nbsp; He informed us via e-mail (which provided his full name and address, but which he asked us not to publish) that he was discouraged by the Archdiocese of Boston from converting to the Catholic Faith.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Greetings in Christ!&nbsp; I have been watching your site for some time now and wanted to know more about your organization. &nbsp;I was at one time very active in the Ecumenical Movement but left some time ago due to what I had seen as being problematic. &nbsp;I do have many questions though and hope you can provide me with some answers please.</p>
<p>“But let me tell you a little bit about myself: I am a Coptic Orthodox Bishop and retired at present. &nbsp;I am also fairly new to the internet as well. &nbsp;I know of several priests and another bishop in Cairo&nbsp;that are thinking of converting to the Catholic faith.</p>
<p><strong>For myself, I was told by the Diocese of Boston that: ‘<u>There is no need to convert, there is salvation for non-Catholics</u>.’</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;I was very disheartened and confused as I am sure you can understand.&nbsp; I do have many concerns and questions concerning Catholic doctrine though.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, this is perfectly in line with the Vatican II sect’s teaching, enunciated by John Paul II and Benedict XVI, that conversion of the “Orthodox” is not the way for unity.&nbsp; It is perfectly in line with the Vatican II sect’s handbook on ecumenism, the outrageous <em>Directory for the Application of the Principles and Norms of Ecumenism</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once again, this is absolute and total proof that the Vatican II sect is not the Catholic Church.</p>
