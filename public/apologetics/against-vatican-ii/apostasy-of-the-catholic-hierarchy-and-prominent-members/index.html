<p style="text-align: center;">The Bishop of Buffalo getting vested by the Dalai Lama in a massive interreligious service of apostasy<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a> (more on this below)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>St. Robert Bellarmine, <em>De Romano Pontifice</em>, lib. II, cap. 30: “<strong>Finally, the Holy Fathers teach unanimously not only that heretics are outside of the Church, but also that they are ‘ipso facto’ deprived of all ecclesiastical jurisdiction and dignity</strong>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s important to emphasize once again the teaching of the Catholic Church that bishops who become heretics immediately lose all authority and any offices they might possess.&nbsp; This is clearly illustrated by the case of the 5<sup>th</sup> century heresiarch, Nestorius, who was Patriarch of Constantinople.&nbsp; On Christmas Day in the year 428, Nestorius denied that Mary was the Mother of God from his pulpit.&nbsp; A simple layman named Eusebius stood up and protested the public heresy.&nbsp; This resulted in the Catholics of Constantinople breaking communion with their bishop, Nestorius; for they recognized that since he was a public heretic, he had no authority in the Church: he lost his office automatically.&nbsp; They even chanted: “An emperor we have, but no bishop.”&nbsp; This reaction was praised by councils and popes, as we see described below.&nbsp; Notice that Pope St. Celestine says that Nestorius had no power to excommunicate after he began to preach heresy.&nbsp; This confirms that heretical bishops lose their offices ipso facto (by that very fact) when they become heretics.&nbsp; And this teaching on the loss of Episcopal office due to heresy applies precisely to the manifestly heretical “bishops” of the Vatican II sect: they have no authority and are outside the Catholic Church, even though they hold the buildings and possess the putative authority of a diocese.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dom Prosper Guéranger, <em>The Liturgical Year</em>, Vol. 4 (St. Cyril of Alexandria), p. 379: “It was then that Satan produced <strong>Nestorius… enthroned in the Chair of Constantinople</strong>… In the very year of his exaltation, on Christmas Day 428, Nestorius, taking advantage of the immense concourse which had assembled in honor of the Virgin Mother and her Child, <strong>pronounced from the Episcopal pulpit the blasphemous words</strong>: ‘Mary did not bring forth God; her Son was only a man, the instrument of the Divinity.’&nbsp; The multitude shuddered with horror.&nbsp; <strong><u>Eusebius, a simple layman, rose to give expression to the general indignation, and protested against this impiety</u></strong>.&nbsp; Soon a more explicit protest was drawn up and disseminated in the name of the members of this grief-stricken <span style="font-size: inherit;">Church, </span><strong style="font-size: inherit;">launching an anathema against anyone who should dare to say</strong><span style="font-size: inherit;">: ‘The Only-begotten Son of the Father and the Son of Mary are different persons.’&nbsp; </span><strong style="font-size: inherit;">This generous attitude was the safeguard of Byzantium, and won the praise of popes and councils</strong><span style="font-size: inherit;">.&nbsp; When the shepherd becomes a wolf, the first duty of the flock is to defend itself.’”</span><a style="font-size: inherit;" href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a></p>
<p>Pope St. Celestine, quoted by St. Robert Bellarmine:<br><strong>"The authority of Our Apostolic See</strong> has determined that the bishop, cleric, or simple Christian who had been deposed or excommunicated by Nestorius or his followers, <strong>after the latter began to preach heresy</strong> <em>shall not be considered deposed or excommunicated</em>. &nbsp;<strong><u>For he who had defected from the faith with such preachings, cannot depose or remove anyone whatsoever</u></strong>."<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[3]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">The “Bishop” of Buffalo gets vested by the Dalai Lama in a massive ecumenical service with Jews, Muslims and heretics which expresses his complete apostasy from the Catholic Faith</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“The remarkable service brought the red-and-gold robed Dalai Lama on a dais with a Muslim imam, Catholic bishop, Baptist preacher and Jewish rabbi, as well as 10 other clergy and area religious leaders… There were readings, prayers and chants from sacred texts, as well as a ritual gonging and three minutes of meditative silence</em>.”<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4">[4]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>People ask us all the time, “What diocese are you under?”&nbsp; “Are you under the bishop?”&nbsp; If we were part of the Vatican II sect, we would be in communion with “Bishop” Edward U. Kmiec, the putative “Bishop” of Buffalo.&nbsp; In the picture above, you can see “Bishop” Kmiec of the Vatican II sect – the putative head of the diocese where our monastery resides – taking part in an interreligious prayer service with the Dalai Lama.&nbsp; Also present were a Muslim imam, a Protestant heretic, and a rabbi.&nbsp; This is exactly the type of interreligious prayer service which Pope Pius XI condemned in <em>Mortalium Animos,</em> and which Pius XI said represents apostasy from the Catholic Faith.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Dalai Lama is the spiritual leader of a pagan religion which leads souls to idolatry and to Hell.&nbsp; The Dalai Lama denies the Holy Trinity and the Divinity of Christ and claims to be a reincarnated being.&nbsp; He is an antichrist. &nbsp;So, who is in communion with the Catholic Church?&nbsp; “Bishop” Kmiec?&nbsp; Or is it those who reject him and hold fast to the fullness of the Faith?&nbsp; Of course, it’s not “Bishop” Kmiec and his false-religion-loving sect.&nbsp; He is outside the Catholic Faith and part of a religion of apostasy.&nbsp; Hence, we can truly say with Catholics of the past, who cried out similarly during the Nestorian heresy (see above): We don’t have a bishop.&nbsp; The teaching of St. Robert Bellarmine cited above, which explains that heretics possess no authority in the Church, applies precisely to this situation.</p>
<p>Also notice that “Bishop” Kmiec is clothed ROUND ABOUT (i.e. around his waist) in purple.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apocalypse 17:4 – "And <strong><u>the woman was clothed round about with purple and scarlet</u></strong>, and gilt with gold, and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand, full of the abomination and filthiness of her fornication."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We will explain more about this later in the book.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">The Head of Russian Bishops tells us that the Vatican II sect has no intention of converting Russian “Orthodox” Schismatics</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“There is no proselytism <u>as a directive on the part of the Holy See</u>, nor is there any intention to convert Russia to Roman Catholicism.”<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5">[5]</a></strong> --Igor Kovalevsky, Secretary General of the <em>Novus Ordo</em> "Conference of Roman Catholic Bishops" of Russia</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Comment: This is easily one of the worst heresies of Vatican II sect, and quite devastating to its claim to be the Catholic Church.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">U.S. Novus Ordo Bishops Officially Join “Christian Churches Together in the U.S.A.” – a Protestant Communion</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>WASHINGTON (AP) – 11/17/04: “The nation's Roman Catholic bishops voted Wednesday to join a new alliance that would be the broadest Christian group ever formed in the United States, linking American evangelicals and Catholics in an ecumenical organization for the first time.</strong> &nbsp;The alliance, called Christian Churches Together in the U.S.A., is set to kick off next year. &nbsp;It would include mainline Protestants, Orthodox Christians, and black and other minority churches. &nbsp;With about 67 million U.S. members, <strong>the Catholic Church would be the largest denomination</strong>.”<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6">[6]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Comment: All over the internet you can find articles about this amazing act of heresy by the U.S. bishops.&nbsp; The Novus Ordo bishops have officially joined </strong>“Christian Churches Together in the U.S.A.,” a Protestant communion which is part of the National Council of Churches.&nbsp; This act is definitely on a level with the incredible <em>Joint Declaration with the Lutherans on Justification,</em> and the Vatican II “popes” repeated acts of repudiating proselytizing the Eastern schismatics.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>With this agreement, the Novus Ordo Church in the U.S.A. has officially repudiated any claim to be the one true Church of Jesus Christ, and has admitted that it is just one of many heretical denominations.&nbsp; It also has officially recognized that the Protestant and schismatic sects which belong to </strong><strong>“Christian Churches Together in the U.S.A.” are part of the true Church of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; </strong>If the Novus Ordo bishops didn’t officially recognize these (non-Catholic) heretical sects and denominations as part of the Christian Church, they would never have joined this heretical group.</p>
<p>Here is the Profession of Faith of the National Council of Churches, of which <strong>“</strong>Christian Churches Together in the U.S.A.” is a part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Statement of Faith: </strong><strong>"The National Council of Churches is&nbsp;a community of Christian communions, which, in response to the gospel as revealed in the Scriptures, confess Jesus Christ, the incarnate Word of God, as Savior and Lord. &nbsp;<u>These communions covenant with one another to manifest ever more fully the unity of the Church</u>. &nbsp;Relying upon the transforming power of the Holy Spirit, the communions come together as the Council in common mission, serving in all creation to the glory of God."&nbsp; </strong><em>--from the Preamble to the NCC Constitution.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means that the members of the National Council of Churches share a communion covenant with all of the other denominations and recognize all the other denominations as manifesting the unity of the Church.&nbsp; This is totally heretical.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">John Paul II’s appointment as New Bishop in Jerusalem says that the Catholic Church has no intention of converting Jews to Christianity!</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>(FROM <em>ISRAEL</em><em> TODAY,</em> JAN. 22, 2004) “<strong>NEW BISHOP IN JERUSALEM IS JEWISH</strong> – For the first time since the Apostle James served as bishop of Jerusalem, <strong>the Holy City has a <em>Jewish</em> bishop</strong>! &nbsp;Benedictine Abbot <strong>Jean-Baptiste Gourion</strong> was ordained as the new bishop at the Catholic church in Kiryat Ye’arim, above the Israeli Arab village of Abu Ghosh near Jerusalem.&nbsp; Bishop Gourion will be responsible for the Hebrew-speaking Catholic community in Israel, many of whom are of Jewish origin... Explaining how he (Bishop Gourion), as a Jew, became a Catholic, he told us: <strong>‘<u>For me, Christianity and Judaism are the same. &nbsp;I didn’t have to leave Judaism to come to Christianity</u>. &nbsp;<u>The Jew and the Christian form the same body</u>.”</strong> <strong>As such, he makes it clear that he will not engage in ‘missionary’ activities</strong>…<br><br>After his ordination,<strong> Israel today</strong> editor Aviel Schneider interviewed the new bishop.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Israel</strong><strong> today:</strong> Congratulations, Bishop Gourion… How did your family react to your new title of bishop?&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Bishop Gourion:</strong> I have a very close relationship with my three siblings, who attended my ordination in Jerusalem and gave me God’s blessing. &nbsp;All in all, I think my appointment by the Catholic Church points to a new era between Jews and Catholic Christians. &nbsp;We have to learn to understand each other better. <strong><u>The Catholic Church has no intention of converting Jews to Christianity</u></strong>. &nbsp;<strong>Therefore, the Pope advocated a Jewish bishop in Israel</strong>…&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Israel</strong><strong> today: </strong>…the Vatican was reluctant to recognize the Jewish state, establishing diplomatic ties with Israel just 10 years ago. One of the reasons is that the Catholic Church thinks of itself as God’s chosen people.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Bishop Gourion:</strong> Well, 40 years ago in the Second Vatican Council, the Church adopted a new theological position toward Israel as God’s chosen people. <strong><u>The Catholic Church does not replace the Jewish people with whom God made an eternal covenant</u></strong>…<br><br><strong>Israel</strong><strong> today:</strong> Do you still think of yourself as part of the Jewish people?&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Bishop Gourion:</strong> Sure. &nbsp;<strong>I see myself as a Jew</strong>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Comment: In 2004, “Bishop” Gourion was appointed by John Paul II as the new auxiliary Bishop of Jerusalem.&nbsp; In the interview, Gourion says that <u>John Paul II specifically appointed Gourion to Jerusalem</u> because of who he is and what he believes.&nbsp; Well, the “new Bishop” Gourion says that he is “a Jew”; that his “Church” (the Vatican sect) “<strong><em>has no intention of converting Jews to Christianity</em></strong>”; that the Jewish covenant with God is still valid and not replaced by the Catholic Church; that the Body of Christ (the Catholic Church) and Judaism are one Body.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are those under Benedict XVI going to tell us that “Bishop” Gourion is a Catholic?&nbsp; Is “Bishop” Gourion a bishop in their “Church” with whom Catholics must share faith and communion – yes or no?&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Pius XII, <em>Mystici Corporis Christi</em> (# 22), June 29, 1943:<br>“As therefore <strong>in the true Christian community</strong> there is only one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, and one Baptism, so <strong><u>there can be only one faith</u></strong>.&nbsp; And therefore if a man refuse to hear the Church let him be considered – so the Lord commands – as a heathen and a publican.&nbsp; It follows that <strong><u>those who are divided in faith or government cannot be living in the unity of such a Body</u></strong>, nor can they be living the life of its one Divine Spirit.”<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7">[7]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To assert that Gourion is a Catholic in the face of this information (i.e., that he is in your Church) is a mortal sin against the Faith and a denial of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; <strong>But those who believe that Benedict XVI is the pope <u>must say</u> that Bishop Gourion <u>is their fellow Catholic</u> who has <u>the same Faith</u></strong> and is in the same Church (Body), as we can see above, because all in the Church have the same Faith (<em>de fide</em>).&nbsp; But if they correctly assert that Gourion is an apostate who is outside the Catholic Church and has no authority, then they must also say the same of Benedict XVI who, as we already saw, believes in the same apostasy on the Jews.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">John Paul II’s “Cardinal Archbishop” of Washington, D.C. confirms John Paul II’s rejection of proselytism (converting others)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“Cardinal Archbishop” Theodore McCarrick, Interview with <em>National Catholic Register</em> about his trip to Moscow to give the Icon of Our Lady of Kazan back to the Schismatics, Sept. 2004:</p>
<p>Q. What did you observe about the relations between Orthodox and Roman Catholics?</p>
<p>A. Cardinal McCarrick: “I think our Orthodox brothers and sisters still may feel threatened by the Roman Catholic Church... There are always going to be some people in communities who feel troubled by other religious communities, <strong><u>possibly fearing that they’re going to proselytize [try to convert them]. I THINK THE HOLY FATHER HAS REALLY BEEN SO CLEAR THAT HIS ROLE IS NEVER TO PROSELYTIZE</u></strong>; his role is to find the key to unity.”<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8">[8]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Comment: Here we see the “head” of the Novus Ordo sect in Washington D.C., a supposed “cardinal,” bluntly admitting that John Paul II “has really been so clear that his role is never to proselytize”!&nbsp; To proselytize is to convert people.&nbsp; If you live in Washington, D.C. and believe that John Paul II is the pope, you would have to admit that this arch-apostate Theodore McCarrick is actually the leader of the Catholic Church in your area.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">The “Archbishop” of Strasbourg admits that the Vatican II sect has abandoned Catholic teaching on the Jews!</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Archbishop Joseph Dore of Strasbourg, France, Speech to B’nai B’rith (Jewish Freemasons), August, 2003: “Whatever the depiction [of the Jews in traditional Catholic art]… <strong>the theological message is the same – God’s election has now passed to the Christian people; and the Church, the true Israel, may triumph, She who confesses the saving truth brought by Christ</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “<strong><u>At Vatican II, the Catholic Church finally revised this teaching</u></strong> and understood to what extent it contradicts the Bible itself... In 1973, the French episcopacy, particularly under the influence of Msgr. Elchinger, [past] Bishop of Strasbourg, published a document of unparalleled moral force on Judeo-Christian relations, while <strong><u>Pope John Paul II recalled on numerous occasions the permanence of the First Covenant</u></strong> [<em>Ed.</em> the Old Covenant], <strong>‘which was never revoked’ by God</strong> [John Paul II, Mainz, Germany, 1980].&nbsp; Today, we desire to work together with our elder brothers toward reconciliation and fraternal dialogue.&nbsp; Yet <strong>we must have the humility to recognize that the doctrine of contempt and the ‘theology of substitution’ – making the Church to be the new and only Israel of God – still penetrate the minds of a large number</strong>.&nbsp; Only by a great labor of education will we ever manage to extirpate all seed of anti-Judaism.&nbsp; Only by a continual purification of memory, making them conscious of their own temptations, will Christians be moved to vigilance and responsibility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Today <u>the Church calls Christians to take the first steps on the path to conversion</u>, inviting them to construct a future with their Jewish brothers in which, together, they might be a ‘blessing for one another’ [John Paul II, 1983].”<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9">[9]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Comment: This is apostasy.&nbsp; It is utter contempt for – and rejection of – the dogma we’ve quoted throughout this book, which declares that the Old Covenant ceased with the coming of Christ and was replaced with the New and Eternal Covenant of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Notice how the execrable apostate, “Archbishop” Dore, references John Paul II’s speech in 1980 (and other statements from John Paul II) to attempt to justify his apostasy.&nbsp; Notice how he refers to the Old Covenant as the “First Covenant,” not the “Old” Covenant, because “Old” implies that it is no longer in force.&nbsp; Notice how he says that “<em>we must have the humility</em>” to abandon the Catholic dogma that the Old Covenant has ceased.&nbsp; Notice how he says that it will require “a great labor” to extirpate (root out) this dogmatic truth from Catholic minds.&nbsp; This is <strong>the “archbishop” of the Vatican II sect in Strasbourg, France</strong>, following the teaching of the Vatican II antipopes.&nbsp; Again, this is nothing other than the counterfeit “Catholic sect” of the Antichrist.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 John 2:22 – “<strong>Who is a liar, but <u>he who denieth that Jesus is the Christ?&nbsp; He is antichrist</u></strong><u>,</u> who denieth the Father, and the Son.”</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">The Novus Ordo Bishops Bluntly Repudiate the Dogmatic Second Council of Lyons and the Council of Florence!</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>“<u>An Agreed Statement of the North American Orthodox-Catholic Theological Consultation</u> Saint Paul’s College, Washington, DC, October 25, 2003 * (U.S. Catholic Bishops – Secretariat for Interreligious Affairs:)*</em></strong></p>
<h3>“IV. Recommendations -“We are aware that <u>the problem of the theology of the <em>Filioque</em></u>… Although dialogue among a number of these Churches and the Orthodox communion has already touched on the issue, any future resolution of the disagreement between East and West on the origin of the Spirit must involve all those communities that profess the Creed of 381 as a standard of faith. &nbsp;Aware of its limitations, <u>our Consultation nonetheless makes the following theological and practical recommen­dations</u> to the members and the bishops of our own Churches…</h3>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>that in the future, because of the progress in mutual understanding that has come about in recent decades, Orthodox and Catholics refrain from labeling as heretical the traditions of the other side on the subject of the procession of the Holy Spirit…</li>
<li>that the Catholic Church, as a consequence of the normative and irrevocable dogmatic value of the Creed of 381, <u>use the original Greek text alone</u> in making translations of that Creed for catechetical and liturgical use.</li>
<li>that the Catholic Church, following a growing theological consensus, and in particular the statements made by Pope Paul VI, <strong><u>declare that the condemnation made at the Second Council of Lyons (1274) of those “who presume to deny that the Holy Spirit proceeds eternally from the Father and the Son” is no longer applicable.</u></strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“We offer these recommendations to our Churches in the conviction, based on our own intense study and discussion, that our traditions’ different ways of understanding the procession of the Holy Spirit need no longer divide us.”<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10">[10]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Comment:&nbsp; This is an incredible heresy, but first a little background.&nbsp; It’s a defined dogma of the Catholic Church that God the Holy Ghost proceeds eternally from the Father and the Son.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Gregory X, <em>Second Council of Lyons</em>, 1274, ex cathedra: “<strong>We profess faithfully and devotedly that the Holy Ghost proceeds eternally from the Father and the Son</strong>, not as from two principles, but as from one principle… <strong>This the holy Roman Church, mother and mistress of all the faithful, has till now professed, preached and taught; this she firmly holds, preaches, professes and teaches</strong>… But because some, on account of ignorance of the said indisputable truth, have fallen into various errors, <strong><u>we, wishing to close the way to such errors, with the approval of the sacred council, condemn and reprove all who presume to deny that the Holy Ghost proceeds eternally from the Father and the Son</u></strong>, or rashly to assert that the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father and the Son as from two principles and not as from one.”<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11">[11]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Eastern schismatics (i.e., the so-called “Orthodox”) reject this dogma.&nbsp; They only believe that the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father; they don’t believe that the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father <u>and the Son</u> (<em>Filioque</em>).&nbsp; So, what do the bishops of the Vatican II sect do in their dialogue with these “Orthodox” schismatics?&nbsp; In their dialogue with these schismatics and heretics, they have issued the above statement which is carried <u>on the official website of the U.S. bishops</u> in union with Benedict XVI.&nbsp; This statement, as can be seen above, <strong>bluntly asserts that the dogmatic definition of the Second Council of Lyons – which declared that the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father <u>and the Son</u> (<em>Filioque</em>) – is no longer applicable!</strong>&nbsp; Nothing could be more formally heretical!&nbsp; <strong>The U.S. bishops in union with John Paul II (and now Benedict XVI) declared that a solemn, <em>ex cathedra</em> pronouncement of a pope at an ecumenical council of the Catholic Church no longer applies</strong>!&nbsp;</p>
<p>The U.S. bishops of the Vatican II sect also recommended that the current version of the Nicene-Constantinople Creed (which is recited every Sunday at Mass), which declares that the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father <em><u>and the Son</u></em> (<em>Filioque</em>), <u>be dropped from all catechetical and liturgical use</u> (see above) – and that only the original creed of 381, which only declared that the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father, be used.&nbsp; For those who don’t know, the Catholic Church lawfully added the phrase “<em>and the Son</em>” to the Nicene-Constantinople Creed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Eugene IV, <em>Council of Florence</em>, “Laetentur coeli,” July 6, 1439, ex cathedra: “In the name of the Holy Trinity, of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, with the approbation of this holy general Council of Florence <strong>we define that this truth of faith be believed and accepted by all Christians, and that all likewise profess that the Holy Ghost is eternally from the Father and the Son… <u>We define in addition that the explanation of the words ‘Filioque’ for the sake of declaring the truth and also because of imminent necessity has been lawfully and reasonably added to the Creed</u>.</strong>”<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12">[12]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>By declaring that the “Filioque” (“<em>and the Son</em>”) dogma is not binding and no longer applicable, the Novus Ordo bishops repudiate two dogmatic councils of the Catholic Church (Lyons II and Florence) at the same time.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Vatican Commission under John Paul II again rejects trying to convert Jews!</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Joint Jewish-“Catholic” Meeting- “<strong>Delegations of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel and of the Holy See’s Commission for Religious Relations with the Jews met for the fourth time</strong> from 17-19 October [2004] in Grottaferrata, Italy.&nbsp; This Joint Committee was established in June 2002.&nbsp; The following is the Committee’s Report of the meeting… 3. <strong><u>The bilateral Committee [of Jews and “Catholics”] reiterated its commitment to the principal declarations of the previous meetings, which included a call for mutual respect of our different religious identities, and affirmed a common rejection of any attempts to persuade people to reject their own heritage</u></strong>… <strong>As believers in the One God</strong> whose name is Peace, prayer was offered up to him to bring an end to war...”<a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13">[13]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Comment:&nbsp; This joint declaration with rabbis appeared in the official Vatican newspaper because it was an act of an official Vatican commission.&nbsp; The joint declaration was signed by five different chief rabbis, two “cardinals,” two bishops, two monsignors, one “archbishop” and a priest, including “Cardinal” Jorge Mejia, Chairman of the “Catholic” delegation of the Vatican.&nbsp; Allow us to put it bluntly:&nbsp; this is antichrist.&nbsp; “<strong>The bilateral Committee [of Jews and Catholics]… affirmed a common rejection of any attempts to persuade people to reject their own heritage</strong>.”&nbsp; This means that the Vatican commission rejects any attempts to persuade the Jews to convert to Jesus Christ and the Catholic Faith.&nbsp; People wonder when the following prophecy of Our Lady of La Salette will come to fruition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our Lady of La Salette, Sept. 19, 1846: “<em>Rome</em><em> will lose the faith and become the Seat of the Antichrist… the Church will be in eclipse</em>.”&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It has come to fruition.&nbsp; The statement of this Vatican commission is perfectly in line with the teaching of John Paul II and Benedict XVI on the Jews, as we saw already.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Hindus Worship the Devil at the Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Frontpage Online</em>, Portugal’s Weekend Newspaper in English, May 22, 2004: “…we can report that the first steps in developing Fátima as a multi-faith centre could have been taken. &nbsp;<strong>On May 5th… <u>Notícias carried a report on a Hindu religious service held in the Chapel of the Apparitions [of Our Lady of Fatima] at the shrine</u></strong>… <strong><u>Sixty Hindus led by a high priest had traveled from Lisbon to pay homage to the Goddess Devi, the divinity of nature</u></strong>. &nbsp;SIC’s reporter described how before leaving Lisbon the Hindus had gathered at their temple in the city to pray to and worship various statues of Hindu gods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “<strong><u>Arriving in Fátima the pilgrims made their way to the Chapel of the Apparitions, where from the altar a Hindu priest led prayer sessions</u></strong>. &nbsp;A commentary on the service was given by the TV reporter who explained: ‘This is an unprecedented unique moment in the history of the shrine. &nbsp;<strong>The Hindu priest, or Sha Tri, prays on the altar the Shaniti Pa</strong>, the prayer for peace.’&nbsp; The Hindus can be seen removing their shoes before approaching the altar rail of the chapel as the priest chants prayers from the altar’s sanctuary… <strong><u>After worshipping their gods and praying in the chapel the Hindus are shown being escorted to an exhibition hall</u> where a model of the controversial new basilica currently being constructed is on display. &nbsp;In a setting described as ambassadorial by the commentator, <u>each Hindu is personally greeted by the Bishop of Leiria - Fátima, who bows to the Hindu priest repeating his gesture of greeting</u></strong><u>. &nbsp;<strong>The Hindu priest is then seen clothing the Rector of the Fátima Shrine and the bishop with a Hindu priestly shawl</strong></u><strong>.</strong>&nbsp; ‘<strong>On the shoulders of the highest representatives of the Church in Fátima, the Hindu priest places a shawl with the inscriptions of the Bhagavad Gita, one of the sacred books of Hinduism</strong>,’ the reporter tells his viewers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “<strong><u>The newscast finishes with scenes of the Hindu priest lighting a candle at the shrine while his followers dance outside the Chapel of the Apparitions chanting praises to their gods</u></strong>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Comment: There you have it.&nbsp; Pagan, idolatrous, demonic worship was conducted at the very chapel built over the spot where Our Lady of Fatima appeared.&nbsp; It happened with the full approval of the Shrine Rector, Msgr. Guerra, and with the full approval of the Bishop of Leiria-Fatima, and with the <u>full approval of the head of the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue</u>, “Archbishop” Michael Fitzgerald.&nbsp; But how can they do this?&nbsp; <strong>They can do it because they learned it from Benedict XVI, John Paul II</strong>, Paul VI and Vatican II, as we have documented.</p>
<p>This latest abomination also shows how misled and deceived are the useful heretics who try to explain away everything.&nbsp; On an April 25 EWTN broadcast, Fr. Mitch Pacwa and Fr. Robert Fox discussed the rumors that Fatima was being turned over to non-Catholic religions.&nbsp; Fr. Robert Fox assured the audience that the whole idea is a “fabrication,” that nothing like this was going on or would go on!&nbsp; Yeah, it is a fabrication all right… and now we see the Hindu idolaters in Fatima conducting their satanic rites in the Chapel of the Apparitions.&nbsp; How long will people listen to these heretics who lead souls to Hell?</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">The Vatican II Sect commemorates Mennonite “martyrdom”</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Mons. John A. Rodano, Vatican Council for Promoting Christian Unity, March, 2004: “An international dialogue between the Catholic Church and the Mennonite World Conference took place 1998-2003… Part III, ‘Toward a Healing of Memories,’ was written in light of bitter memories of the past and especially, from <strong>the Mennonite perspective</strong>, <strong><u>their memory of persecution and martyrdom in the 16th century</u></strong>, and in light of our isolation from one another since that time.&nbsp; <strong>It outlines four steps that could be taken toward a healing of memories</strong>…</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “In a common statement, <strong>Catholics and Mennonites together regret that they and other Christians ‘were unable to resolve the problems of the Church of that time in such a way as to prevent <u>divisions in the Body of Christ that have lasted to the present day</u></strong>.’”<a href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17">[17]</a>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Comment:&nbsp; In early March of 2004, the Vatican II sect was following John Paul II’s lead by commemorating the Lutheran pastor, Paul Schneider.&nbsp; Late in March of the same year, the Vatican II sect commemorated Mennonite “martyrdom.”&nbsp; This is formal heresy coming out basically on a weekly basis.&nbsp; Could the Vatican II sect deny the dogma Outside the Church There is No Salvation any more clearly or consistently?&nbsp; What kind of “Catholic” could affirm communion with such a “hierarchy” while aware of these facts?</p>
<p>The common statement above presents the divisions between Catholics and Mennonites (in other words, the heresies of the Mennonites) as “<em>problems of the Church at that time,</em>” for which seemingly both sides were to blame.&nbsp; In other words, the Mennonites aren’t the ones guilty of heresy for leaving the Body of Christ and following their man-made religion!&nbsp;</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Comment: Here we see the Vatican Council for Promoting Christian Unity commemorating a Lutheran heretic as a martyr for the faith.&nbsp; This is formal heresy against the Council of Florence.&nbsp; Consult the earlier sections of this book which deal with proving that John Paul II repeatedly taught that there are saints outside the Church.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">The Vatican II sect praises and celebrates John Wesley, the founder of the Methodist sect</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Fr. Donald Bolen, Vatican Council for Promoting Christian Unity, Feb. 2004: “2003 was an eventful year in relations between the Catholic Church and the World Methodist Council<strong>… In June 2003, Methodists worldwide celebrated the 300th anniversary of the birth of John Wesley</strong>, and in small but significant ways, invited the Catholic Church to join in these celebrations… <strong><u>Cardinal Walter Kasper, President of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity, preached at the Methodist Church in Rome on the occasion of the 300th anniversary of the birth of John Wesley.&nbsp; Later in the year, he sent a message to a celebration marking both the anniversary of Wesley’s birth and that of the Chapel</u></strong><u> <strong>Wesley opened in London 225 years ago</strong></u><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>“Cardinal Kasper made use of the opportunity provided by these occasions to contribute to a Catholic reassessment of John Wesley, particularly attentive to ‘<u>his wholehearted commitment to spreading the good news of salvation, his fostering of Scriptural holiness and structuring of communities of Christians for witness and mission</u>.’</strong></p>
<p><strong>“Cardinal Kasper noted that ‘<u>We must also</u> seek a wider view, to <u>see what dynamized Wesley’s ministry, to see the evangelical passion which gave direction to his life and the movement he started</u></strong>.’</p>
<p><strong>“Kasper stressed that <u>this reassessment of Wesley, which was ‘rich with possibilities</u></strong>,’ was possible because Catholics could now look to Wesley through eyes educated by our international dialogue and by the emergence of friendship and shared mission in various local contexts throughout the world, wherein ‘<strong><u>we have come to recognize each other as brothers and sisters in Christ</u>.’</strong></p>
<p>“Addressing the congregation of Methodists Cardinal Kasper noted that just as Methodists ‘<strong>continue to turn to the ministry of John Wesley for inspiration and guidance, <u>we can look to see and find in him the evangelical zeal, the pursuit of holiness</u></strong>, the concern for the poor, <strong><u>the virtues and goodness which we have come to know and respect in you</u></strong>.&nbsp; Cardinal Kasper’s homily and message were warmly received and much appreciated.”<a href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21">[21]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Comment: John Wesley was a non-Catholic heretic, and the founder of his own religion.&nbsp; He started out as an Anglican, and then formed Methodism.&nbsp; Wesley denied the Papacy; he denied many of the dogmatic councils of the Catholic Church; he denied apostolic succession; he denied all but two of the seven sacraments, admitting only Baptism and the Eucharist, but he rejected that Baptism confers sanctifying grace and he denied that Our Lord is truly present in the Eucharist.&nbsp; He denied Purgatory, and he held that man is justified by faith alone and thereby assured of his salvation.&nbsp; How is that for “<em>wholehearted commitment to spreading the good news of salvation</em>”? &nbsp;How is that for “<em>fostering of Scriptural holiness and structuring of communities of Christians</em>”?&nbsp; How is that for “<em>evangelical zeal, the pursuit of holiness… the virtues and goodness which we have come to know and respect in you</em>”?&nbsp; Yes, heresy, schism and the spreading of false doctrines of the worst kind – including the evil doctrine of faith alone – are “virtues” that the Vatican II sect wants to come to know and respect in everyone.</p>
<p>The article also calls for the Methodists to affirm the <em>Joint Declaration with the Lutherans on Justification</em>, which totally repudiates the Council of Trent.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><em>No Words of Consecration, No Problem</em>.&nbsp; The Vatican, with the approval of John Paul II and Benedict XVI, approves a “Mass” as valid which has no words of Consecration!</h3>
<p>Preliminary Comment: The following is an excerpt from a document issued by the Vatican, and approved by “Cardinal” Ratzinger and John Paul II, on whether Chaldean Eastern Rite Catholics are permitted to have inter-Communion with the Assyrian schismatics of the East, who are non-Catholics who reject the Catholic Church.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The document says <em>yes;</em> therefore, the Assyrian schismatic non-Catholics are allowed to receive Holy Communion from Catholic ministers, while the Chaldean “Catholics” are also allowed to receive Communion at the Assyrian Schismatic churches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides the obvious sin of heretical inter-Communion with non-Catholics, there is an additional problem.&nbsp; <strong>These Assyrian Schismatics – unlike most Eastern Schismatics – don’t have any words of Consecration in their liturgy!</strong>&nbsp; Their liturgy doesn’t even have “This is My Body” or “This is My Blood, etc.”; it doesn’t have <em>the words of Institution</em>, as the words of consecration are frequently called!&nbsp; Thus, the Assyrian Schismatic Liturgy isn’t even valid.&nbsp; But the following document of the Vatican essentially tells us: <em>no words of consecration, no problem</em>!&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“PONTIFICAL COUNCIL FOR PROMOTING CHRISTIAN UNITY- <strong><em>GUIDELINES FOR ADMISSION TO THE EUCHARIST BETWEEN THE CHALDEAN CHURCH AND THE ASSYRIAN CHURCH OF THE EAST, July 20, 2001:</em></strong></p>
<p>“The present guidelines subsequently have been elaborated by the <em>Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity</em>, in agreement with the <em>Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and the Congregation for the Oriental Churches</em><strong>… 3. … </strong><strong>The principal issue for the Catholic Church in agreeing to this request</strong>, related to the question of the validity of the Eucharist celebrated with the Anaphora of Addai and Mari, one of the three Anaphoras traditionally used by the Assyrian Church of the East. &nbsp;The Anaphora of Addai and Mari is notable because, from time immemorial, <u>it has been used without a recitation of the Institution Narrative</u>. &nbsp;<strong>As the Catholic Church considers the words of the Eucharistic Institution a constitutive and therefore indispensable part of the Anaphora or Eucharistic Prayer,</strong> a long and careful study was undertaken of the Anaphora of Addai and Mari, from a historical, liturgical and theological perspective, at the end of which the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith on January 17<sup>th</sup>, 2001 concluded <u>that this Anaphora can be considered valid</u>. &nbsp;H.H. <strong>Pope John Paul II has approved this decision</strong> … the words of Eucharistic Institution are indeed present in the Anaphora of Addai and Mari, <strong>not in a coherent narrative way and <em>ad litteram</em></strong>, <u>but rather in a dispersed euchological way</u>, that is, integrated in successive prayers of thanksgiving, praise and intercession.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Comment:&nbsp; Here the official Vatican document, approved by John Paul II, is admitting that the words of “Eucharistic Institution” (the words of Consecration which Christ Himself instituted as necessary for the confection of the Eucharist) are not present in this Assyrian liturgy.&nbsp; After admitting this fact, it tries to explain it away by asserting that the words of consecration are present in a “dispersed euchological way,” which is a neat way of saying that they’re not actually present, but they are somehow accounted for in other “prayers <em>of thanksgiving, praise and intercession</em>” which mention nothing of them!&nbsp; How convenient!&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to this outrageous document, the words of consecration are accounted for in other prayers of thanksgiving, praise and intercession which don’t mention them. &nbsp;This heresy devastates all Catholic sacramental teaching.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Eugene IV, <em>Council of Florence</em>, Session 8, Nov. 22, 1439, "Exultate Deo":&nbsp; "All these sacraments are made up of three elements: namely, things as the <u>matter</u>, words as the <u>form</u>, and the person of the <u>minister</u> who confers the sacrament with the <u>intention</u> of doing what the Church does. &nbsp;<strong>If any of these is lacking, the sacrament is not effected."<a href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22">[22]</a></strong></p>
<p>Pope St. Pius V, <em>De Defectibus</em>, chapter 5, Part 1: <br>"The words of Consecration, which are the FORM of this Sacrament, are these: <em>FOR THIS IS MY BODY</em>. &nbsp;And: <em>FOR THIS IS THE CHALICE OF MY BLOOD, OF THE NEW AND ETERNAL TESTAMENT: THE MYSTERY OF FAITH, WHICH SHALL BE SHED FOR YOU AND FOR MANY UNTO THE REMISSION OF SINS.</em> &nbsp;Now if one were to remove, or change anything in the FORM of the consecration of the Body and Blood, and in that very change of words the [new] wording would fail to mean the same thing, he would not consecrate the sacrament."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In light of these facts, one can see that this heresy of the Vatican II sect, John Paul II and Benedict XVI is equivalent to saying that one can validly baptize without water.&nbsp; It’s a rejection of the <em>substance of the sacraments</em>, those things specifically instituted by the Lord Himself as necessary for the confection of the Sacraments, which no man – not even a <em>true</em> Pope – has any power to change or alter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Pius XII, <em>Sacramentum Ordinis</em> (# 1), Nov. 30, 1947: <br>"… <strong>the Church has no power over the 'substance of the sacraments</strong>,' that is, over those things which, with the sources of divine revelation as witnesses, Christ the Lord Himself decreed to be preserved in a sacramental sign..."<a href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23">[23]</a></p>
<p>Pope St. Pius X, <em>Ex quo</em>, Dec. 26, 1910: "… <strong>it is well known that to the Church there belongs no right whatsoever to innovate anything touching on the substance of the sacraments.</strong>"<a href="#_edn24" name="_ednref24">[24]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We continue with another short excerpt from this document:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&nbsp;“4. Guidelines for admission to the Eucharist- </strong>…1.&nbsp; When necessity requires, Assyrian faithful are permitted to participate and to receive Holy Communion in a Chaldean celebration of the Holy Eucharist; in the same way, <strong><u>Chaldean faithful</u> for whom it is physically or morally impossible to approach a Catholic minister, <u>are permitted to participate and to receive Holy Communion in an Assyrian celebration of the Holy Eucharist</u></strong>. &nbsp;2. &nbsp;In both cases, Assyrian and Chaldean ministers celebrate the Holy Eucharist according to the liturgical prescriptions and customs <strong><u>of their own tradition</u>.</strong> &nbsp;3. When Chaldean faithful are participating in an Assyrian celebration of the Holy Eucharist, the Assyrian minister <strong><u>is warmly invited to insert the words of the Institution</u></strong> in the Anaphora of Addai and Mari, as allowed by the Holy Synod of the Assyrian Church of the East.” (<em>Rome</em><em>, July 20<sup>th</sup>, 2001)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice how the Vatican document “warmly invites” the Assyrian schismatics to use the words of Institution.&nbsp; But if the schismatics aren’t “warmed up” to this idea, no problem – it’s somehow valid anyway according to the Vatican II sect.&nbsp; In light of these facts, how is affirming communion with these men any different from affirming communion with Protestant ministers?</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">The Novus Ordo Bishop of Kansas City denies the Perpetual Virginity of Our Lady</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>FROM AN ARTICLE IN <em>THE ANGELUS</em>, publication of the Society of St. Pius X (SSPX), Dec. 2003, pp. 32-37: “… I pointed out to you [Bishop Boland of Kansas City] that George Noonan, on the radio program [an allegedly ‘Catholic’ program in Bishop Boland’s diocese], had denied the necessity of sanctifying grace for the salvation of one’s soul.&nbsp; <strong>You [Bishop Boland] immediately defended Mr. Noonan by stating that it is not necessary for [to have] sanctifying grace to save one’s soul</strong>… When I informed you [Bishop Boland] that George Noonan (on the radio program) was silent as to whether or not he believed in the principle of logic of non-contradiction, <strong>you stated that the law of non-contradiction – where two contradictory statements could not both be true – was in fact, false</strong>… During our conversation, we also got off on a tangent as regards the lack of respect shown by Rabbi Michael Zedik concerning the Blessed Mother and how George Noonan, as the Catholic co-host, did not defend Our Lady’s dignity as being a perpetual virgin.&nbsp; <strong><u>You indicated that it has yet to be proven that Our Lady did not have any children other than Our Lord</u>…</strong> <u>This quickly led into our last discussion in which you stated that the Church’s doctrine can change and has changed</u>.&nbsp; My father and I wholeheartedly disagreed with you on this point…”<a href="#_edn25" name="_ednref25">[25]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Comment: Would you believe that “Bishop” Boland is the “head” of the Novus Ordo/Vatican II sect in Kansas City?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Pius IX, <em>First Vatican Council</em>, Session 4, Chap. 3, <em>ex cathedra</em>:<br>"This power of the Supreme Pontiff is so far from interfering with that power of ordinary and immediate Episcopal jurisdiction by which the <strong>bishops</strong>… have succeeded to the places of the apostles, as true shepherds individually feed <strong><u>and rule</u> the individual flocks entrusted to them</strong>."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Bishop” Boland denies that sanctifying grace is necessary for salvation; he denies the law of non-contradiction; he denies the perpetual virginity of Our Lady; and he holds that Catholic doctrine can change.&nbsp; Bishop Boland is a manifest heretic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Paul IV, Cum quorundam, <em>Council of Trent</em>, 1555: “… the most blessed and <strong>ever Virgin Mary</strong>…”<a href="#_edn26" name="_ednref26">[26]</a></p>
<p>Pope Martin I, <em>First Lateran Council</em>, 649, Can. 3: “<strong>If anyone does not properly and truly confess</strong> in accord with the holy Fathers, that the holy Mother of God and ever Virgin and immaculate Mary… <strong>her virginity remaining indestructible even after His birth, let him be condemned</strong>.”<a href="#_edn27" name="_ednref27">[27]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Bishop” Boland is obviously not the visible head and authority of the Catholic Church in Kansas City, but the ruler of a non-Catholic sect which poses as the Catholic Church in Kansas City (the Vatican II/Novus Ordo sect).&nbsp; And as incredibly heretical as he is, “<strong>Bishop” Boland is probably average among the Novus Ordo bishops</strong>.&nbsp; But groups like the SSPX still recognize Boland as a Catholic and the head of the diocese; their priests in Kansas City pray for him as their legitimate bishop each Sunday at Mass, and they continue to call him “Your Excellency”!&nbsp; Since they are obstinate in this position, this is very offensive to God and to Our Lady.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>FROM THE SAME ARTICLE IN <em>THE ANGELUS</em>, publication of the SSPX, Dec. 2003, pp. 33-37: “Your Excellency… Your Excellency… Your Excellency… Your Excellency… Most of all, Your Excellency...

<p>At the 2003 Fatima Conference hosted by the Novus Ordo clergy, the dogmatic definition of the Council of Florence was called “horrible”!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Catholic Family News</em>, Dec. 2003, pp. 20-21: “… I have covered a number of these post-conciliar conferences including New Evangelization Seminars, Rock’n’-Roll World Youth Days, screaming charismatic meetings, and evenings of Jewish-Catholic dialogue.&nbsp; <strong>Yet the most explicit heresy I have ever heard at any of these events came from the mouth of the Belgian Jesuit Father Jacques Dupuis, only a few hundred yards from where Our Lady of Fatima appeared… On the point of ‘outside the Church there is no salvation,’ Fr. Dupuis said in disgust, ‘<u>There is no need to invoke here that horrible text from the Council of Florence in 1442</u></strong>.’”<a href="#_edn29" name="_ednref29">[29]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Comment: We’ve already documented that the shrine of Our Lady of Fatima was invaded by the Hindus with the full permission of the Vatican II sect.&nbsp; It’s also said that it’s going to be turned into an interfaith shrine open to all religions.&nbsp; At the Fatima conference where this diabolical idea was put forward, Fr. Jacques Dupuis called the following dogmatic definition of the Council of Florence on outside the Church there is no salvation “horrible.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Eugene IV, Council of Florence, “Cantate Domino,” 1441-1442, ex cathedra:<br>“The Holy Roman Church firmly believes, professes and preaches that all those who are outside the Catholic Church, not only pagans but also Jews or heretics and schismatics, cannot share in eternal life and will go into the everlasting fire which was prepared for the devil and his angels, unless they are joined to the Church before the end of their lives; that the unity of this ecclesiastical body is of such importance that only for those who abide in it do the Church’s sacraments contribute to salvation and do fasts, almsgiving and other works of piety and practices of the Christian militia produce eternal rewards; and that nobody can be saved, no matter how much he has given away in alms and even if he has shed blood in the name of Christ, unless he has persevered in the bosom and unity of the Catholic Church.”<a href="#_edn30" name="_ednref30">[30]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Msgr. Guerra (<strong>the Fatima Shrine Rector)</strong>, <strong><u>as well as John Paul II’s own Apostolic Delegate to Portugal and the Bishop of Leiria-Fatima, were also present and applauded Fr. Dupuis’ heresy</u>.</strong>&nbsp; This means that the man put in charge of the shrine by the Vatican II sect, as well as the bishop over the territory, applauded the aforementioned speech which called the Council of Florence’s solemn teaching “horrible”!&nbsp; The crowd in attendance also applauded the speech, which was filled with heresy and apostasy throughout.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To maintain the Faith, it is not enough to oppose these incredible abominations and heresies, if one<u> still affirms communion and faith</u> with these men.&nbsp; <strong>To affirm communion and faith with such men is to deny the Faith by mixing Fatima with apostasy, by saying that one can be an apostate and hold the authority of the Church of Christ in Fatima</strong>.</p>
<p>Even “conservative” Novus Ordo “bishops,” such as “Bishop” Fabian Bruskewitz and “Cardinal” George, are complete apostates</p>
<p>Even if one looks at the most conservative members of the “hierarchy” under Benedict XVI, such as “Bishop” Fabian Bruskewitz of Lincoln, Nebraska, one sees that they are complete apostates.&nbsp; “<strong>Bishop” Bruskewitz “presided over an ecumenical prayer service and breakfast together with an Anglican ‘bishop’ and assorted Lutheran ‘ministers.’</strong>”<a href="#_edn31" name="_ednref31">[31]</a></p>
<p>“Bishop” Bruskewitz “also respectfully attended the [invalid] ‘consecration’ of Methodist ‘bishop’ Joel Martinez, who has publicly recalled (in a sermon on May 21, 2000) the joyous day his mother left the Catholic Church...”<a href="#_edn32" name="_ednref32">[32]</a>&nbsp; One of Bruskewitz’s own parishes “conducts what it calls a ‘Sermon a la Carte’ program, in which parishioners are urged to attend sermons by the ministers of these very sects [i.e. various Protestant sects], as well as the local Methodist and Lutheran ‘churches.’” <a href="#_edn33" name="_ednref33">[33]</a>&nbsp; This is heretical.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Pius IX, <em>Graves</em><em> ac diuturnae</em> (# 4), March 23, 1875: “<strong><u>They [the faithful] should totally shun their religious celebrations, their buildings,</u></strong> and their chairs of pestilence which they have with impunity established to transmit the sacred teachings.&nbsp; They should shun their writings and all contact with them.&nbsp; They should not have any dealings or meetings with usurping priests and apostates from the faith who dare to exercise the duties of an ecclesiastical minister without possessing a legitimate mission or any jurisdiction.”<a href="#_edn34" name="_ednref34">[34]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Worst of all, <strong>“Bishop” Bruskewitz actually conducted an interfaith Seder Supper with a group of rabbis in his own cathedral</strong> during Holy Week, thus committing a horrible act of apostasy, heresy and mortal sin.<a href="#_edn35" name="_ednref35">[35]</a>&nbsp; All of this proves that “Bishop” Bruskewitz, perhaps the most conservative “bishop” of the Vatican II hierarchy, is also a manifest heretic and an apostate.</p>
<p>Regarding “Cardinal” George, we already pointed out that in his diocesan newspaper he wrote that “The Church has also sinned against the Jewish people, first of all, in teaching that God’s covenant with Israel is no longer valid…”<a href="#_edn36" name="_ednref36">[36]</a>&nbsp; This means that George holds that the Jews have a valid covenant with God and don’t need to convert to the Catholic Faith or Jesus Christ for salvation.&nbsp; All of these “bishops” also accept the heresies of Vatican II, the incredible <em>Joint Declaration with the Lutherans on Justification</em>, and the ecumenism of the Vatican II antipopes.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Every year the Vatican sends a message commemorating Buddhist feast of Vesakh</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Vatican Message to Buddhists on feast of Vesakh, Archbishop Michael Fitzgerald, <strong>president of the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue, 4/30/04</strong>:</p>
<p>“<strong>Dear Buddhist Friends</strong>: 1. I am writing to you again this year<strong> to express my heartfelt greetings on the occasion of your festival of Vesakh. &nbsp;I pray that each and every one of you may have a joyful and peaceful feast</strong>. &nbsp;Vesakh offers an opportunity for us Christians to visit our Buddhist friends and neighbors to exchange greetings, and this helps to strengthen the bonds of friendship already established and to create new ones. &nbsp;It is my wish that such cordial links may continue to grow generation after generation, sharing with each other our joys and hopes, our sorrows and preoccupations…”<a href="#_edn37" name="_ednref37">[37]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Every year the Vatican Congratulates Muslims for the end of Ramadan</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“Archbishop” Michael Fitzgerald, Head of Vatican Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue:</p>
<p><em>Dear Muslim Friends,</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li><strong>It is a pleasure for me to address you on the occasion of <em>'Id al-Fitr</em>, which concludes the month of Ramadan</strong>, in order to offer you friendly greetings on behalf of the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue and indeed on behalf of the whole Catholic Church… 4. <strong>As believers in the One God</strong> we see it as our duty to strive to bring about peace. Christians and Muslims, we believe that peace is above all a gift from God. This is why our two communities pray for peace; it is something they are always called to do.&nbsp; <strong>As you know, Pope John Paul II invited representatives of different religions to come to Assisi, the city of St Francis, on 24 January 2002,</strong> in order to pray and to commit themselves to peace in the world…</li>
<li>In bringing about peace, and maintaining it, <strong>religions </strong><strong>have an important role to play</strong>… 6. It is at what is a very special time for you, the month of Ramadan <strong>in which fasting, prayer and solidarity bring you interior peace,</strong> that I am sharing with you these reflections on the ways to peace. I express to you, therefore, good wishes of peace, peace in your hearts, in your families and in your respective countries, and I invoke upon you the Blessing of the God of Peace.”<a href="#_edn38" name="_ednref38">[38]</a> –<strong>Archbishop Michael L. Fitzgerald, </strong><em>President</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Comment: This is total apostasy.&nbsp; And this is why Pope Pius XI says (as quoted already) that those who favor interreligious prayer gatherings, such as the Vatican II antipopes and its apostate bishops, <u>are not only in error and deceived</u>, but have completely rejected the true religion.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope St. Leo the Great (+ c. 450): “For whoever is led away from the path of the true faith, and changed to another, <strong>his whole journey is an apostasy; and the further he travels from the Catholic light, the nearer he comes to the darkness of death.”<a href="#_edn39" name="_ednref39">[39]</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Every year the Vatican Sends a Message to Hindus on the Feast of Diwali!</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“Dear Hindu Friends,</p>
<p>”1. This year again, I am pleased to greet you and share with you a short message on the occasion of Diwali, the feast <strong>which you celebrate according to your venerable religious tradition</strong>. &nbsp;I know that among many Hindu festivals which are celebrated by you throughout the year this one, in particular, has a special place and deep relevance for you and your families. &nbsp;<strong>Diwali is a time for families to get together, and celebrate in a meaningful way the rites prescribed by the ancient dharma</strong>… <strong>Do not your various Hindu traditions (sampradaya) eloquently speak not only of God's love</strong> for us and our love for God but also of the love that human beings must have for one another?… <strong><u>The occasion of the festival of Diwali provides us with ample food for thought when the Hindu tradition informs us of how light overcomes darkness, how the victory of good is achieved over evil</u> </strong>and how hatred gives way to love through forgiveness. &nbsp;Dear Hindu friends, may you, your families, friends and even the strangers in your midst experience joy, peace, serenity, and light on the feast of Diwali, as symbolized by the innumerable flames, the Deepavali.”<a href="#_edn40" name="_ednref40">[40]</a> - Sent by Archbishop Michael L. Fitzgerald (10-14-2003), President of the Vatican Council for Interreligious Dialogue</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Comment:&nbsp; <strong>Fitzgerald even tells the Hindus that their false religion of the Devil “informs us of how light overcomes darkness.”</strong>&nbsp; If Fitzgerald were not a complete apostate himself who unfortunately lies in spiritual darkness, he would discover that those outside the kingdom of Christ lie in the kingdom of darkness (Colossians 1:13).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Colossians 1:13:&nbsp; “Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of the Son of His love.”</p>
<p>Pope Leo XIII, <em>Ad Extremas</em> (#1), June 24, 1893: “Our thoughts turn first of all to the <strong>blessed Apostle Thomas who is rightly called the founder of preaching the Gospel to the Hindus</strong>.&nbsp; Then, there is Francis Xavier… Through his extraordinary perseverance, <strong>he converted <u>hundreds of thousands of Hindus from the myths and vile superstitions of the Brahmans to the true religion</u></strong>.&nbsp; In the footsteps of this holy man followed numerous priests… they are continuing these noble efforts; nevertheless, in the vast reaches of the Earth, <strong>many are still deprived of the truth, <u>miserably imprisoned in the darkness of superstition</u></strong>.”<a href="#_edn41" name="_ednref41">[41]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">The Vatican II sect teaches that Jews and Muslims are the spiritual seed of Abraham, which is a denial of Jesus Christ</h3>
<p>A common heresy of the Vatican II sect is the idea that Jews and Muslims are the spiritual seed of Abraham; or, to put it another way, the idea that Christianity, Islam and Judaism are all heirs to the faith of Abraham.&nbsp; This heresy is taught by many in the Vatican II sect, but was most prominently inculcated by John Paul II.&nbsp; This heresy rejects the divinely revealed truth that <u>Christ is the seed of Abraham, and that <em>only those who accept Christ are the spiritual seed of Abraham</em></u>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When God promised Abraham that, “<em>In your descendants all nations of the earth will be blessed, because you have obeyed my voice</em>” (Gen. 22:18), He was referring to Our Lord Jesus Christ, as St. Paul makes <u>quite clear</u>.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Galatians 3:14- "<em>That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles <u>through Christ Jesus</u></em>: <strong>that we may receive the promise of the spirit by faith</strong>.”</p>
<p>Galatians 3:29- “<strong><u>And</u></strong><u> <strong>if you be Christ’s</strong></u><strong>; then you are the seed of Abraham</strong>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following <em>truly great</em> popes make this clear as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope St. Gregory the Great (+ c. 590): “… <em><u>if you be Christ’s then you are the seed of Abraham</u></em> (Gal. 3:29).&nbsp; <strong>If we because of our faith in Christ are deemed children of Abraham, <u>the Jews therefore because of their perfidy have ceased to be His seed</u></strong>.”<a href="#_edn42" name="_ednref42">[42]</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pope St. Leo the Great, Dogmatic Letter to Flavian (449), read at Council of Chalcedon (451), <em>ex cathedra</em>: “The promises were spoken to Abraham and his seed.&nbsp; <u>He does not say “to his seeds” – as if referring to multiplicity – but to a single one</u>, <strong>‘and to thy seed,’ which is Christ </strong>(Gal. 3:16).”<a href="#_edn43" name="_ednref43">[43]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet, the leaders of the Vatican II sect frequently deny this infallible truth of Scripture and Catholic dogma by asserting that the Jews and Muslims are the spiritual descendants or "children" of Abraham.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>John Paul II, <em>Homily</em>, March 7, 1982: “<strong><u>Abraham’s descendants in faith</u> are, in a certain sense, the followers of the three great monotheistic religions of the world: Judaism, Christianity, Islam.&nbsp; </strong>‘<em>In your descendants all nations of the earth will be blessed, because you have obeyed my voice</em>’ (Gen. 22:18).”</p>
<p>John Paul II, <em>Address to Roman Citizens</em>, Jan. 15, 1998: <strong>“I cordially greet you</strong>, Roman citizens, who belong to other religious traditions: <strong><u>you, Jews, heirs to the faith of Abraham</u></strong>, who for centuries have shared in the spiritual and civil life in Rome; you, brothers and sisters of the Christian confessions; <strong>you, believers of the Muslim religion.&nbsp; May common adoration of the Most High</strong> foster mutual respect and make you all active builders of an open and united society.”</p>
<p>John Paul II, <em>Homily, </em>Jan. 1, 2002: “This appeal is first and foremost for those who believe in God, <strong><u>in particular for the great ‘Abrahamic religions’: Judaism, Christianity and Islam</u></strong>, called to declare their firm and decisive rejection of violence.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Comment: This is a major denial of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; Notice above how John Paul II even quoted the promise made to Abraham in Gen. 22:18 and attributed <u>this blessing to Judaism and Islam</u>!&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Galatians 3:29- “<strong><u>And</u></strong><u> <strong>if you be Christ’s</strong></u><strong>; then you are the seed of Abraham</strong>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Summary of the Apostasy of the Hierarchy and Members of the Vatican II Sect</strong></h3>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>We have exhaustively documented the blatant heresies and apostasy of the hierarchy and prominent members of the Vatican II sect.&nbsp;&nbsp; We could continue for many pages, but this suffices to establish that we are definitely in the Great Apostasy, and that the religion to which they adhere (the post-Vatican II “Catholicism”) is a counterfeit sect which Catholics must completely reject.</p>
