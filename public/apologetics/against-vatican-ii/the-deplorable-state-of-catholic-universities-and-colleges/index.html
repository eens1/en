<p>Every “Catholic” college or university in communion with Benedict XVI is rife with heresy and indifferentism and/or the promotion of the gay agenda and/or attacks on Sacred Scripture and/or attacks on the historicity of Our Lord or all of the above.&nbsp; Honorary degrees are frequently given to pro-abortionists.&nbsp; Pro-abortionists are often commencement speakers at these “Catholic” colleges, where the most outrageous scandals abound.&nbsp; Now we will look at just a few snapshots of the heresy, apostasy and immorality that characterize “Catholic” colleges and universities.&nbsp; One could write an entire book filled with examples of what we’re about to cover.</p>
<p>In 2004, 29 so-called “Catholic Colleges” actually showed the abominable play, <em>The Vagina Monologues</em>.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a>&nbsp; In February of 2005, 27 showed the play.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a>&nbsp; People need to consider the level of apostasy that such a fact reveals; this outrage was actually performed on these “Catholic” campuses, where they have members of the clergy in positions of authority!&nbsp; In the same year, at least 16 “Catholic” colleges had pro-abortion commencement speakers.&nbsp; In May 2005, “Catholic” Marymount Manhattan College had Hillary Clinton as commencement speaker. <a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[3]</a>&nbsp; Clinton has spoken at other “Catholic” colleges, including Canisius in Buffalo, NY.<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4">[4]</a>&nbsp; Non-Catholic and pro-abortion commencement speakers are so common at “Catholic” universities that it would be a major project to keep track of them all.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Loyola University Chicago, “Chicago’s Jesuit University,” actually welcomed Kyan Douglas, the homosexual actor from “Queer Eye for the Straight Guy,” with a prominent link and picture on its website.<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5">[5]</a>&nbsp; The same university openly promotes lesbianism and homosexuality.<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6">[6]</a></p>
<p>A “study conducted by the University of California-Los Angeles showed that Catholic students’ moral views were weaker, rather than stronger, after four years on a ‘Catholic’ college campus. At thirty-eight of the Catholic colleges surveyed, 37.9 percent of Catholic freshmen said in 1997 that abortion should be legal.&nbsp; Four years later, as seniors, 51.7 percent supported legalized abortion.”<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7">[7]</a></p>
<p>The U.S. school named after Mary—the University of Notre Dame—has twice <u>hosted a Queer Film Festival</u>.&nbsp; Its head of theology, “Fr.” Richard McBrien, denies the most basic Catholic dogmas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jesuit University of San Francisco offers benefits to homosexual couples.<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8">[8]</a></p>
<p>Santa Clara University, a “Jesuit” institution in California, featured two speakers from the National Center for Lesbian Rights in Feb. 2004 to promote legal issues facing homosexual partners.<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9">[9]</a></p>
<p>DePaul University, the largest “Catholic” university in America, offers a minor in “Queer Studies.”<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10">[10]</a></p>
<p>The “Catholic University of America,” like all the major “Catholic” colleges and universities, is rife with heresy and apostasy.&nbsp; On April 26, 2006, CUA hosted an interfaith luncheon.&nbsp; “<strong>Approximately 100 guests, representing Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox/Oriental Christian, Protestant, Jewish, Muslim and Eastern faith groups</strong>, participated in a 1 p.m. luncheon hosted by Rev. David M. O’Connell, C.M., President of Catholic University.&nbsp; In his welcoming remarks to those assembled, Father O’Connell reflected that religion has always played a significant role in the development of world cultures,”<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11">[11]</a> <em>as if their false religions of the Devil were a positive and God-willed aspect of the establishment of cultures</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Fr.” O’Connell <strong>also encouraged them in their own prayers</strong>, commemorated the spirit of Assisi, and “joined together in prayer” with the infidels, pagans and heretics.&nbsp; Someone we know who attended CUA called it the most wicked place he’s ever been: the spirit of apostasy from the true Faith in a place claiming to represent it was such a unique and deep form of evil that one could feel it.</p>
<p>“Catholic” Seton Hall University is a home for people of all religions.&nbsp; Its official website declares: “<strong><u>Whether you are looking for a nearby synagogue</u>, a Muslim group to join for Friday prayers</strong> or an interfaith Bible study, <u>Campus Ministry [at Seton Hall] will connect you</u> with students who share in your beliefs.”<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12">[12]</a>&nbsp; This is total apostasy, of course – encouraging people to practice Judaism, Islam, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seton Hall also gave the “Sandra Day O’Connor Award” to pro-abortion judge Maryanne Trump Barry.&nbsp; Sandra Day O’Connor, who is herself pro-abortion and was the key vote in striking down the anti-abortion laws in almost 30 states, presented the award named after herself to the pro-abortion judge who struck down New Jersey’s partial-birth abortion ban.<a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13">[13]</a>&nbsp; There are only two words for this: insanity and apostasy.</p>
<p>“Catholic” Marquette University promotes interfaith apostasy.&nbsp; As one of many examples, its website states: “University Ministry will hold an interfaith prayer for peace… Please join us to hear the call from <strong>religious leaders from diverse faith traditions</strong> and denominations <strong>as they join their voices in prayer</strong> for a peaceful resolution to the potential for war in Iraq.”<a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14">[14]</a></p>
<p>“Catholic” Duquesne University is particularly open about its apostasy.&nbsp; Its website also <u>goes so far as to compile a list with the addresses of the local non-Catholic churches and temples</u> so that its students can go worship at them.&nbsp; <strong>This list includes Protestant and schismatic churches, synagogues, mosques and the Hindu Jain Temple</strong>!&nbsp; So much for it being a “Catholic” University dedicated to the one true Faith!</p>
<p>“The Office of Spiritan Campus Ministry has compiled this list for all students to use so that they may practice their faith while away at school. &nbsp;If no listing of a time is given, a phone number is listed to call and inquire. &nbsp;The starred locations (*) are within walking distance. &nbsp;Duquesne is an urban campus with many churches and other places of worship nearby. &nbsp;<strong><u>We will be happy to help you find one that suits your needs</u></strong>.”<a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15">[15]</a></p>
<p>“Catholic” <strong>Xavier University</strong> in Ohio openly encourages people to practice non-Catholic religions.&nbsp; It “<strong>provides opportunities for worship</strong> and spiritual development <strong>for those of <u>all faith traditions</u></strong>.&nbsp; Information about Protestant, Jewish and other local faith communities is available at the office of campus ministry.”<a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16">[16]</a>&nbsp; This is total apostasy.</p>
<p>“Jesuit” <strong>Georgetown</strong><strong> University</strong> features a course called “Problem of God.”&nbsp; The goal of the course is to bring about an acceptance of <u>all religions</u>.</p>
<p>“The [non-Catholic] students admit they were skeptical when first learning the course was part of their curriculum. &nbsp;When Kholoud told her family she would be taking a class called Problem of God taught by a Catholic priest, <u>they wondered if she would be converted</u>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“’<strong>He's not here to do that,’ Kholoud says of Maher</strong>. ‘He's here to talk about faith. &nbsp;My idea is different from his, but <strong><u>he helps us develop acceptance of other faiths</u></strong>.’&nbsp; Maher also helped lay such fears [that he wanted to convert anyone] to rest during the first week of class when he said matter-of-factly: ‘I'm sure that people will be asking, <strong><u>'Does Father Maher want to convert us?' ... Of course, the answer is yes. &nbsp;I want to convert all of us from a childhood understanding and grasp on our faith to an adult understanding and grasp on our faith</u></strong>.’”<a href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17">[17]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, the “priest” teaching at “Catholic” Georgetown University admits that he doesn’t want to convert people to the Catholic Faith, but rather to “convert” them to a deeper understanding of their own faiths, whatever they may be.&nbsp; And the purpose of his course “Problem of God” is to bring about an acceptance of all religions.&nbsp; This is <u>total</u> apostasy.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">2006 Interfaith Apostasy at Georgetown in commemoration of Assisi<a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18">[18]</a></p>
<p>On the 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary of John Paul II’s interreligious prayer meeting at Assisi, many “Catholic” colleges and universities held small gatherings of the same type to commemorate the event.&nbsp; “Catholic” Georgetown held <em>International Prayer for Peace 2006: A Meeting of Peoples and Religions in the Spirit of Assisi</em>.<a href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19">[19]</a>&nbsp; Georgetown also offers Ministry programs for the promotion of Judaism, Islam, Protestantism and Eastern “Orthodoxy.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In addition to extensive worship services offered by specific religious traditions, <strong>the Office of Campus Ministry provides opportunities for interfaith prayer</strong> and dialogue throughout the school year. &nbsp;Events include interfaith dialogues, <strong><u>interfaith meditation</u></strong>, Hallelujah Shabbat, <strong><u>Interfaith Seder</u></strong> and an interfaith art exhibit.” <a href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20">[20]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means Georgetown promotes the practice of Judaism directly on its website.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>Protestant, Jewish and Muslim worship takes place on campus [at Georgetown] in services organized by the Office of Campus Ministry</strong> and student groups.&nbsp; Bible studies, daily retreats and three Sunday worship services in the Protestant tradition take place on campus. &nbsp;<strong>The Jewish Chaplains and the Jewish Student Association hold a Shabbat dinner each Friday. &nbsp;A Muslim prayer room in Copley Hall is used for Islamic prayer</strong> and worship daily and there is a large Muslim community worship service each Friday. &nbsp;On Tuesday evenings there is an Orthodox prayer service in Copley Crypt.”<a href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21">[21]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Jesuit” <strong>Boston</strong><strong> College</strong> is likewise fraught with apostasy.&nbsp; On Feb. 9, 2005, it hosted a panel discussion on the American “bishops” August 2002 document <em>Reflections on Covenant and Mission.&nbsp; This notorious document stated that </em>“… campaigns that target Jews for conversion to Christianity are no longer theologically acceptable in the Catholic Church.”&nbsp; <strong>Three Boston College “theologians” addressed the issue: “Should Catholics Seek to Convert Jews (If Jews are in a true covenant with God)?”</strong>&nbsp; All three indicated – in their modernist way of saying a lot while saying almost nothing – that there is no necessity whatsoever for Jews to be converted.&nbsp; The clearest answer came from Boston College “theologian” Philip Cunningham, who stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If, as Christians would certainly posit, the birth of the Church was part of the divine plan, <strong>then Christians must contemplate the possibility that the Jewish “no” to the Gospel</strong> <strong>and the development of the post-Temple rabbinic heritage</strong> <strong>were also parts of the divine plan</strong>.”<a href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22">[22]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>“No” to the Gospel may be part of the divine plan, according to “Catholic” Boston College.</p>
<p>Arguably the most “prestigious” “Catholic” university in the world is <strong>the Angelicum </strong>in Rome.&nbsp; It promotes the same apostasy exemplified by all the other “Catholic” colleges and universities.&nbsp; It offers a course on ecumenism which promotes ecumenism in line with <em>The </em><em>Directory for the Application of the Principles and Norms on Ecumenism</em>, which was promulgated by John Paul II.<a href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23">[23]</a>&nbsp; This incredible Directory discourages converting non-Catholics, promotes interfaith worship services, sharing of churches with false religions and sects, etc., as covered earlier in this book.</p>
<p><strong>The Gregorian </strong>in Rome is another famous “Catholic” institution.&nbsp; Well, the former Anglican “Archbishop” of Canterbury, George Carey, teaches ecumenism there.<a href="#_edn24" name="_ednref24">[24]</a>&nbsp; This means that a non-Catholic heretic – a layman who posed as a valid bishop – is teaching heretical ecumenism to Novus Ordo seminarians and clergy.&nbsp; We suspect that they won’t be covering the invalidity of Anglican orders.</p>
<p><u>We could continue for many pages</u> documenting the apostasy, immorality and scandal at the so-called “Catholic” colleges and universities, but one should see very clearly that the apostasy of the educational institutions of the Vatican II sect is universal.&nbsp; It goes from the local college of the Vatican II sect here in America, all the way to the most prestigious ones in Rome.&nbsp; This is simply because <u>they’re all following the new religion of the Vatican II sect.</u>&nbsp; They are, like the Vatican II sect that endorses them, <u>Catholic in name only</u>.</p>
