<p><em>John Paul II during a syncretist prayer gathering with various false religious leaders at Assisi in 1986 - This “ecumenical” activity was always condemned by the Catholic Church, and specifically labeled as a complete rejection of the Catholic Faith by Pope Pius XI in 1928.  This is a revolution against the Faith – a new Gospel.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Luke 18:8- “But yet the Son of man, when he cometh, shall he find, think you, faith on earth?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the Gospel, Our Lord Jesus Christ informs us that in the last days the true Faith would hardly be found on the earth.&nbsp; He tells us that “in the holy place” itself there will be “the abomination of desolation” (Mt. 24:15), and a deception so profound that, if it were possible, even the elect would be deceived (Mt. 24:24).&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Matthew 24:15- “<strong>When therefore you shall see the abomination of desolation, which was spoken of by Daniel the prophet, <u>standing in the holy place</u></strong>: he that readeth let him understand.”</p>
<p>Matthew 24:24-25- “For there shall arise false Christs and false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders, <strong>insomuch as to deceive (if possible) even the elect</strong>.&nbsp; Behold I have told it to you, beforehand.”</p>
<p>2 Thess. 2:3-5- “Let no man deceive you by any means, for unless there come <em><u>a revolt</u></em> [apostasy] first, and the man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition, Who opposeth, and is lifted up above all that is called God, or that is worshipped, <strong><u>so that he sitteth in the temple of God</u></strong>, shewing himself as if he were God.&nbsp; Remember you not, that when I was yet with you, I told you these things?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1903, Pope St. Pius X thought that he might be seeing the beginning of the evils which will fully come to pass in the last days.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope St. Pius X, <em>E Supremi</em> (# 5), Oct. 4, 1903: “… <strong>there is good reason to fear lest this great perversity may be as it were a foretaste, and perhaps the beginning of those evils which are reserved for the last days; and that there may already be in the world the ‘Son of Perdition’ of whom the Apostle speaks</strong> (2 Thess. 2:3).”<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The New Testament tells us that this deception will happen in the very heart of the Church’s physical structures,</strong> <strong>in “the Temple of God” (2 Thess. 2:4) and “in the holy place” (Mt. 24:15).&nbsp; </strong>It will arise because people receive not the love of the truth (2 Thessalonians 2:10).</p>
<p>In 2 Thessalonians 2, St. Paul speaks of the last days being characterized by a great apostasy that will be the worst ever – even worse than was experienced in the Arian crisis in the 4<sup>th</sup> century, in which an authentically Catholic priest was hardly to be found.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fr. William Jurgens: “At one point in the Church’s history, only a few years before Gregory’s [Nazianz] present preaching (A.D. 380), <strong>perhaps the number of Catholic bishops in possession of sees, as opposed to Arian bishops in possession of sees, was no greater than something between 1% and 3% of the total.</strong>&nbsp; Had doctrine been determined by popularity, today we should all be deniers of Christ and opponents of the Spirit.”<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a></p>
<p>Fr. William Jurgens: “<strong>In the time of the Emperor Valens (4<sup>th</sup> century), Basil was virtually the only orthodox Bishop in all the East who succeeded in retaining charge of his see</strong>… If it has no other importance for modern man, a knowledge of the history of Arianism should demonstrate at least that the Catholic Church takes no account of popularity and numbers in shaping and maintaining doctrine: else, we should long since have had to abandon Basil and Hilary and Athanasius and Liberius and Ossius and call ourselves after Arius.”<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>St. Gregory Nazianz (+380), <em>Against the Arians</em>: “Where are they who revile us for our poverty and pride themselves in their riches?&nbsp; <strong>They who define the Church by numbers and scorn the little flock?”<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4">[4]</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the Arian crisis – just a prelude to the Great Apostasy – was this extensive, how extensive will the Great Apostasy foretold by Our Lord and Saint Paul be?&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Prophecy of St. Nicholas of Fluh (1417-1487): “The Church will be punished because the majority of her members, high and low, will become so perverted.&nbsp; <strong>The Church will sink deeper and deeper until she will at last seem to be extinguished, and the succession of Peter and the other Apostles to have expired</strong>.&nbsp; But, after this, she will be victoriously exalted in the sight of all doubters.”<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5">[5]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>St. Paul further says that this apostasy will result in a man sitting in the temple of God and “shewing himself as if he were God.”&nbsp; Later in this book, we prove that this is exactly what has happened by a man sitting in St. Peter’s Basilica declaring that he and everyone else is God.<em>&nbsp; </em></p>
<p>Fr. Herman Kramer was a Catholic priest who spent 30 years studying and writing a book on the Apocalypse.&nbsp; In his book, he wrote the following about St. Paul’s prophecy concerning the Antichrist sitting in the Temple of God.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“St. Paul says that Antichrist ‘sitteth in the temple of God’… This is <u>not</u> the ancient Temple of Jerusalem, nor a temple like it built by Antichrist, as some have thought, for then it would be his own temple… this temple is shown to be a Catholic Church, possibly one of the churches in Jerusalem or <strong><u>St. Peter’s in Rome, which is the largest church in the world and is in the full sense ‘The Temple of God</u></strong>.’”<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6">[6]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em>Notice that Kramer says that “the Temple of God” probably refers to St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Pius XI, <em>Quinguagesimo ante</em> (#30), Dec. 23, 1929: “… such a great number of them <u>came to the Basilica of St. Peter’s</u> for the jubilee of indulgence that We have probably <strong>never seen that great temple</strong> so crowded.”<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7">[7]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em><em>The Catholic Encyclopedia</em> article on “Antichrist” indicates that St. Bernard believed that the Antichrist would be an antipope:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“...St. Bernard speaks in the passage of the Antipope [as the Beast of the Apocalypse].”<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8">[8]</a></p>
<p>Bl. Joachim (d. 1202): “Towards the end of the world, Antichrist will overthrow the pope and usurp his see.”<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9">[9]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But whether or not one believes that the Antichrist will be an antipope, it has definitely been prophesied that the forces of Antichrist will overtake Rome in the final days.&nbsp; On Sept. 19, 1846, Our Lady of La Salette prophesied that Rome would lose the Faith and become the Seat of the Antichrist in a final days apostasy from the one true Catholic Faith.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our Lady of La Salette, Sept. 19, 1846: <strong>“Rome will lose the Faith and become the seat of the Anti-Christ… the Church will be in eclipse.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<figure><img src="https://i.ibb.co/9Nfgyns/our-lady-of-la-salette.jpg">
</figure>

<p>This startling prophecy coincides with the prophecies in Sacred Scripture (Apocalypse 17 and 18), which inform us that the city of seven hills (Rome) will become a harlot (a counterfeit Bride of Christ), which will commit spiritual fornication (idolatry) and tread upon the blood of the saints (false ecumenism).&nbsp; The great harlot prophesied in the Bible is not the Catholic Church; it is a counterfeit Catholic Church, an apostate, phony Bride which arises in the last days to deceive Catholics and eclipse the true Church which has been reduced to a remnant.&nbsp; In this book we will bring forward the overwhelming, undeniable, irrefutable evidence from doctrinal grounds and unassailable facts that the “Church” which has arisen with the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965) is not the Catholic Church at all, but rather a massively fraudulent Counter-Church which denies the fundamental teachings of the Catholic Church.</p>
<p>We will show that the men who imposed this new Vatican II religion and the New Mass were not Catholics at all, but manifest heretics preaching a new religion.</p>
<p><strong>In fact, any doubts about the authenticity of Our Lady’s message at La Salette will be obliterated by a careful examination of the evidence in this book</strong>.&nbsp; Among other things, this book will document that the Vatican now teaches that Jews are perfectly free <u>not</u> to believe in Jesus Christ.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i.ibb.co/37cb3YQ/anti-pope-john-paul-ii-elio-toaff.jpg">
</figure>

<p>This may startle some, but this is a fact.&nbsp; Without even considering all of the other apostasy which we will cover in this book, this fact proves that Our Lady’s words have come true: Rome (not the Catholic Church) has lost the Faith (given way to a non-Catholic, counterfeit sect) and become the seat of the Antichrist.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In late 2001, the Pontifical Biblical Commission released a book entitled <em>The Jewish People and the Holy Scriptures in the Christian Bible.&nbsp; </em>The book <strong><u>argues that the Jews’ continued wait for the Messiah is validated and justified by the Old Testament</u></strong>.&nbsp; “The expectancy of the Messiah was justified in the Old Testament,” papal spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls explained, “and if the Old Testament keeps its value, then it keeps that as a value, too.&nbsp; <u>It says you cannot just say all the Jews are wrong and we are right</u>.”&nbsp; Asked by reporters whether his statements might be taken to suggest that the Messiah may not in fact have come, Navarro-Valls replied, “It means it would be wrong for a Catholic to wait for the Messiah, <u>but not for a Jew</u>.”&nbsp; This means that the Vatican now holds that the Jews are perfectly free to reject Christ; this is the teaching of the Vatican II “popes.”</p>
<p>Rome has lost the Faith and become the seat of the Antichrist.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 John 2:22 – “Who is a liar, but<strong> <u>he who denieth that Jesus is the Christ? &nbsp;He is antichrist</u></strong><u>,</u> who denieth the Father, and the Son.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But how did this come about, and what are Catholics to do about it?&nbsp; This book will endeavor to answer both of those questions in detail.</p>
