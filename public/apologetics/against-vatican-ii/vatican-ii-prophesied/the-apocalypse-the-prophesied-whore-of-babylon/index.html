<p>Source: <a href="https://vaticancatholic.com/apocalypse/">vaticancatholic.com</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><spanstyle="font-size: 14pt;">Apocalypse 17:4- "<strong>And the woman was clothed round about with purple and scarlet</strong>, and gilt with gold, and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand, full of the abomination and filthiness of her fornication."</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>None of the points which follow are necessary to prove that the Vatican II sect and its antipopes are not Catholic.  The doctrinal evidence covered throughout this book proves this in detail.  However, the points which follow are interesting and enlightening as they help to further explain why this catastrophic crisis is occurring, and what to make of it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apocalypse 17:1: "And there came one of the seven angels, who had the seven vials, and spoke with me, saying: Come, I will show thee the condemnation of <strong>the great harlot, who sitteth upon many waters..."</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chapters 17 and 18 of the Apocalypse make striking prophecies about the “great harlot” or the “Whore of Babylon” which will arise in the last days from the city of seven hills.  Rome was constructed on seven hills.  This is why throughout history Rome has been identified as the city of seven hills mentioned in the Apocalypse.  Based on this, Protestants throughout the centuries have accused the Catholic Church of being the Whore of Babylon.  But the Protestants are wrong, of course, because the Catholic Church is the immaculate Bride of Christ, the one true Church He founded.  What <strong>the Whore of Babylon describes, however, is <em>a counterfeit Bride – a Counter-Catholic Church</em></strong> – which arises in the last days in order to deceive Catholics (the true faithful), tread upon the faith and commit spiritual fornication.</p>
<h3>1. The whore sits upon many waters.</h3>
<p>As we saw already, the great harlot sits upon many waters.  The Apocalypse clues us in as to what these waters are.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apocalypse 17:15- "And he said to me: <strong>The waters which thou sawest, where the harlot sitteth, are peoples, and nations, and tongues</strong>."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Peoples, nations, and tongues" are suggestive of global influence, something which has influence in all ends of the earth.  Immediately Rome and the Catholic Church come to mind.  The Catholic Church’s universal mission has incorporated faithful from all peoples, nations and tongues.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Pius XII, <em>Fidei donum</em> (# 46), April 21, 1957: “Now, <strong>our holy Mother the Church is indeed the Mother ‘of all nations, of all peoples</strong>, as well as of individual persons…”<a id="_ednref1" title="" href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And <span style="text-decoration: underline;">since Rome is the headquarters of the universal Church</span>, <strong>if Rome were taken over by an antipope who imposed a new religion, it could then influence almost all of the peoples, nations and tongues into its spiritual infidelity</strong>.  That is why the harlot sits upon peoples, nations and tongues.  In fact, the Council of Trent infallibly confirms our hunch – that the waters upon which the harlot sits are connected with the almost universal expanse that a final days, <em>counterfeit Catholic Church</em> would have if an antipope or set of antipopes successfully overtook Rome – with alarming specificity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Pius IV, <em>Council of Trent</em>, Session 22, On the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass: "The holy synod then admonishes priests that it has been prescribed by the Church to mix water with the wine to be offered in the chalice, not only because the belief is that Christ the Lord did so, but also because there came from His side water together with blood, since by this mixture the sacrament is recalled.  <strong>And since in the Apocalypse of the blessed John the peoples are called waters [Apoc. 17:1, 15], the union of the faithful people with Christ, their head, is represented."<a id="_ednref2" title="" href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2"><strong>[2]</strong></a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice that the Council of Trent infallibly declares that the waters of Apoc. 17:1,15 represent the union of the faithful people with Christ; in other words, the Catholic Church.  <strong>The great harlot sits upon these waters!</strong>  Therefore, it is of the Catholic faith that the great harlot sits upon the Catholic Church, that is, she impedes, obstructs, suppresses and attempts to substitute for her.  <strong>This is a perfect description of the false Church that arose with Vatican Council II</strong>, which has successfully deceived most of the world into thinking that it is the true Catholic Church.</p>
<p>Understanding that the "waters" of the Apocalypse represent the peoples, nations, and tongues of the Catholic Church, could be the key to understanding other important verses in this book.  For example, Apoc. 18:17 talks about how the shipmasters and the mariners wept over the destruction of the great city.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apocalypse 18:17- "For in one hour are so great riches come to nought; and <strong>every shipmaster, and all that sail into the lake, and mariners, and as many as work in the sea</strong>, stood afar off, And cried, seeing the place of her burning, saying: What city is like to this great city?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The shipmasters, mariners and those that work in the sea represent those who work with souls in the Catholic Church; that is, priests, religious, etc.  They weep over the desolation of Rome and wonder how in such a short time she has been brought down.</p>
<h3>2. The whore sits upon the city of seven mountains.</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Apocalypse 17:9- "And here is the understanding that hath wisdom.  The seven heads are <strong>seven mountains, upon which the woman sitteth</strong>, and they are seven kings."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As stated already, Rome was constructed on seven hills.  Since the great harlot sits upon the city of seven hills, the great harlot sits upon Rome itself – the center of unity in the Catholic Church and the home of the Roman Pontiffs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Benedict XIV, <em>Apostolica Constitutio</em> (# 4), June 26, 1749:
<strong>"... the Catholic Church is signified by the City of Rome alone,</strong> in which the bodily presence of this Apostle [Peter] is carefully reverenced..."<a id="_ednref3" title="" href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[3]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rome</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> only gives way to the great harlot in the last days</span> – i.e., after the Vatican II revolution.  This is why the harlot is only mentioned in the book of the Apocalypse.  And this is why Sacred Scripture speaks of the "fall" of Babylon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apocalypse 18:2- "And he cried out with a loud strong voice, saying: <strong>Babylon</strong><strong> the great is fallen, is fallen</strong>; and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is become</span> the habitation of devils, and the hold of every unclean spirit, and the hold of every unclean and hateful bird."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Babylon has historically been regarded as a code name for Rome.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 Peter 5:13- "The Church that is in <strong>Babylon</strong>, elected together with you, saluteth you: and so doth my son Mark."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Scripture scholars understand that St. Peter was writing this epistle from Rome, which he calls “Babylon.”  Therefore, Rome is Babylon and Babylon has fallen.  But if it has fallen, then it once stood strongly.  And is this not true?  For prior to its fall, Rome (Babylon) was the bulwark of Catholicism and the center of Christianity - the great city.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apocalypse 17:18- "And the woman which thou sawest, is the great city, which hath kingdom over the kings of the earth."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some may ask: "If Rome is the 'great city,' why does Apocalypse 11:8 say that the great city is the place where Our Lord was crucified, which is Jerusalem?"  The answer is that it doesn’t actually say that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apoc. 11:8 - “[the two witnesses] shall lie in the street of <em>the great city, <strong>which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt,</strong> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">even where</span> their Lord was crucified</strong></em>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice that, contrary to what some have claimed, the Apocalypse doesn’t clearly state that the two witnesses (which some believe describe Peter and Paul) are killed in the city where Our Lord was crucified.  Notice that the passage could very well mean that the great city <em>is called Sodom and Egypt even where their Lord was crucified</em>.  In other words, the great city, Rome, is referred to as “Sodom” and “Egypt” as far away as Jerusalem (where their Lord was crucified) because of its immoralities!  This makes sense when we consider that Rome was notorious for its corruption.  Hence, this passage doesn’t clearly prove, as some have suggested, that Jerusalem must be the great city.</p>
<p>Another consideration is that the Mystical Body of Christ is being crucified in and from Rome at present, so in that sense it would also be accurate to say that Rome is the place where Our Lord is crucified in His Mystical Body.</p>
<p>The great city is Rome.  Historically, no other city has ruled over the kings of the Earth as has Rome, which has a spiritual and ecclesiastical primacy which all nations must be subject to.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Leo XII, <em>Quod Hoc Ineunte</em> (# 6), May 24, 1824:
<strong>"Come therefore to this holy Jerusalem, a priestly and royal city which the sacred seat of Peter has made the capitol of the world</strong>.  <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Truly it rules more widely by divine religion than by earthly domination</span>."<a id="_ednref4" title="" href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4"><strong>[4]</strong></a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And whether the kings of the earth want to accept it or not, all human creatures must be subject to the spiritual power of the Catholic Church, which (when there is a true pope) is exercised from Rome.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Boniface VIII, <em>Unam Sanctam</em>, Nov. 18, 1302:
"Now, therefore<strong>, we declare, say, determine and pronounce that for every human creature it is necessary for salvation to be subject to the Roman pontiff."<a id="_ednref5" title="" href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5"><strong>[5]</strong></a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the fall of the great city is the fall of Rome from the Catholic faith.  It’s not the fall of the Catholic Church, for the Catholic Church can exist without Rome.  It can be reduced to a remnant, just as it is predicted by Our Lord when He speaks about the end of the world (Luke 18:8).  Rome, on the other hand, can't exist without Catholicism.  Without it, she becomes nothing more than “the habitation of devils, and the hold of every unclean spirit, and the hold of every unclean and hateful bird” (Apoc. 18:2).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Our Lady of La Salette</em>, Sept. 19, 1846, an approved apparition of the Catholic Church: “Rome will lose the Faith and become the seat of the Anti-Christ.” <a id="sdendnote14anc" name="sdendnote14anc"></a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>3. The whore is a woman.</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Apocalypse 17:6-7 -"And I saw <strong>the woman</strong> drunk with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus.  And I wondered, when I had seen <span style="text-decoration: underline;">her</span>, with great admiration.  And the angel said to me: Why dost thou wonder?  I will tell thee the mystery of <strong>the woman</strong>, and of the beast which carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If it is true that the Whore of Babylon is the phony Catholic Church that began with the Vatican II revolution (as the evidence in this book overwhelmingly shows), it would make sense that this apocalyptic entity is described as a woman, in order to contrast her with another woman – her antithesis – the Catholic Church.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Boniface VIII, <em>Unam Sanctam</em>, Nov. 18, 1302: "'One is my dove, my perfect one.  <strong>One she is</strong> of her mother, the chosen of her that bore her' [Cant. 6:8]; which represents the one mystical body whose head is Christ, of Christ indeed, as God."<a id="_ednref6" title="" href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6">[6]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>4. The whore is a mother.</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Apocalypse 17:5- "And on her forehead a name was written: A mystery; Babylon the great, <strong>the mother of the fornications</strong>, and the abominations of the earth."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Catholics have always referred to the Church as their mother.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Leo XIII, <em>Satis Cognitum</em> (# 16), June 29, 1896:
"Let us love the Lord our God; let us love His Church; the Lord as our Father, <strong>the Church as our Mother."<a id="_ednref7" title="" href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7"><strong>[7]</strong></a></strong></p>
<p>Pope Pius XI, <em>Mortalium Animos</em> (# 11), Jan. 6, 1928:
"For if, as they continually state, they long to be united with Us and ours, why do they not hasten to enter the Church, <strong>'the Mother </strong>and mistress<strong> of all Christ's faithful'?"<a id="_ednref8" title="" href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8"><strong>[8]</strong></a></strong></p>
<p>Pope Pius XII, <em>Mystici Corporis Christi</em> (# 66), June 29, 1943:
"<strong>Certainly the loving Mother is spotless</strong> in the Sacraments, by which she gives birth to and nourishes her children; in the faith which she has always preserved inviolate..."<a id="_ednref9" title="" href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9">[9]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fact, the Roman Church is specifically called the “mother and mistress” of all the churches (i.e. all the particular churches in communion with the universal Catholic Church).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Leo XIII, <em>Exeunte Iam Anno </em>(# 2), Dec. 25, 1888:
"… <strong>the Roman Church, mother and mistress</strong> <strong>of all Churches</strong>..."<a id="_ednref10" title="" href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10"><strong><strong>[10]</strong></strong></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s quite obvious that the Apocalypse describes the Whore of Babylon as the “mother of the fornications” because the Counter Church overtakes <em>Rome</em>, where a true pope normally presides over <em>the Mother Church</em>.  Rome has become the mother fornicator in an almost universal counterfeit Catholic Church of the last days.  And we see this in action: the apostasy and spiritual fornication of the Counter Church <em>starts in Rome</em> and then spreads to all of the local churches in the counterfeit sect.  For example: the religious indifferentism practiced in Rome is spread to the rest of the false Church.</p>
<p>Thus, as the Catholic Church is our loving Mother, the whore is the Mother of the fornications.  And as the Catholic Church is the Mother of all Christ's faithful, the whore is the Mother of Christ's unfaithful, that is, those who have abandoned the Church and accepted the new Vatican II religion.</p>
<h3>5. The whore is clothed in purple and scarlet.</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Apocalypse 17:4- "And <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the woman was clothed round about with purple and scarlet</span></strong>, and gilt with gold, and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand, full of the abomination and filthiness of her fornication."</p>
<p>Apocalypse 18:16- "And saying: Alas! alas! that great city, <strong>which was clothed with fine linen, and purple, and scarlet</strong>, and was gilt with gold, and precious stones, and pearls."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is perhaps one of the most revealing verses in the Apocalypse.  <strong>In the Catholic Church, bishops wear purple and cardinals wear scarlet (red)!</strong>  Notice that they are clothed “round about” (around their waists) in these colors.</p>
<p>By choosing to describe the Whore of Babylon as a woman “clothed with fine linen, and purple, and scarlet,” God is giving us <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a clear indication</span> that the whore is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">clothed</span> in the colors of the true episcopate and cardinalate.  God is giving us a clear indication that the whore is clothed in these colors because <strong>externally she gives all the appearances of being the true Church of Christ –</strong> she has dioceses, a hierarchy, the property of the Church, vestments, ceremonies, "sacraments," a "pope," etc. – <span style="text-decoration: underline;">but inwardly she is a fraud</span>.  This is a perfect description of the Church of the Vatican II sect, the end-time Counter Church, which is clothed with the colors of Catholicism (and appears to most to be just that) but inwardly is a false apostate religion.</p>
<h3>6. The whore has a golden cup in her hand.</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Apocalypse 17:4- "And the woman was clothed round about with purple and scarlet, and gilt with gold, and precious stones and pearls<strong>, having a golden cup in her hand</strong>, full of the abomination and filthiness of her fornication."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Priests offering the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass in the Catholic Church are required to use a chalice of gold, if possible.  It's no coincidence that the whore has a golden cup in her hand.  The whore, as usual, is mimicking, acting and pretending to be the Catholic Church; but she is not.  A Catholic priest offers the golden chalice full of the Precious Blood of Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.  <strong>The whore offers a cup (chalice) full of abomination and filthiness – the invalid wine of the New Mass</strong>!</p>
<p>In particular, this verse is referring to the <em>Novus Ordo Missae</em> (the New Mass), which does not contain the Blood of Jesus Christ, but an offering which is an abomination in His sight.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apocalypse 18:6- "Render to her as she also hath rendered to you; and double unto her double according to her works: <strong>in the cup wherein she hath mingled</strong>, mingle ye double unto her."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The word mingle means to mix.<a id="_ednref11" title="" href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11">[11]</a>  In the Catholic Mass, the Church mingles the water with the wine in the chalice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Eugene IV, <em>Council of Florence</em>, Session 8, Nov. 22, 1439, "Exultate Deo": "For blessed Alexander, the fifth Pope after blessed Peter, says: 'In the offerings of the sacraments which are offered to the Lord within the solemnities of Masses, let only bread and <strong>wine mixed with water be offered as a sacrifice</strong>.  For either wine alone or water alone must not be offered in the chalice of the Lord, <strong>but both mixed</strong>, because it is read that both, that is, blood and water, flowed from the side of Christ.'  <em>Then also, because it is fitting to signify the effect of this sacrament, which is the union of the Christian people with Chris</em><em>t</em>.  For water signifies the people, according to the passage in the Apocalypse: 'the many waters... are many people' [Apoc. 17:15]... <em>Therefore, <strong>when wine and water are mixed</strong> in the chalice the people are made one with Christ, and the multitude of the faithful is joined and connected with Him in whom it believes</em>."<a id="_ednref12" title="" href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12">[12]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The symbolism of Apocalypse 18:6 – mingling in a cup – couldn’t be more obvious without giving away the mystery of the verse</strong>.  It's an obvious reference to the Mass, which has been completely perverted by the harlot.  She has nothing left to offer to God in her cup but filthiness and abomination (Apoc. 17:4).  Furthermore, this verse (18:6) points to a specific point in the Mass, the mixing of wine and water.  This action of mixing signifies the union of the Christian people with Christ (the Catholic Church), as Pope Eugene IV defined at the Council of Florence.  As we have shown, this is the precise signification which has been removed from the consecration of the New Mass, rendering it invalid!</p>
<p>In one and the same verse, therefore, God is revealing that the whore is conducting massive spiritual fornication in areas which regard the Catholic Mass and the Catholic Church as a whole. It is a startling description of the Vatican II sect: the end-time Counter-Church.</p>
<h3>7. The whore is characterized by fornication and whoredom.</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Apocalypse 17:1-2- "Come, I will show thee the condemnation of <strong>the great harlot</strong>, who sitteth upon many waters, With whom the kings of the earth <strong>have committed fornication</strong>; and they who inhabit the earth have been made drunk with the wine of <strong>her whoredom</strong>."</p>
<p>Apocalypse 18:3- "Because all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of <strong>her fornication</strong>; and <strong>the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her</strong>; and the merchants of the earth have been made rich by the power of her delicacies."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s simply a fact that when the term fornication is used in Holy Scripture, many times it describes idolatry and spiritual infidelity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Exodus 34:16- “Neither shalt thou take of their daughters to wife for thy son, lest after they themselves have committed fornication, <strong>they make thy sons also to commit fornication with their gods</strong>.”</p>
<p>Judges 2:17- “<strong>Committing fornication with strange gods</strong>, and adoring them.  They quickly forsook the way, in which their fathers had walked: and hearing the commandments of the Lord, they did all things contrary.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many other passages could be given to show that Scripture describes spiritual infidelity and idolatry as fornication, whoredom and harlotry.  When a “great harlot” committing world-wide fornication is spoken of in this context, it clearly indicates apostasy from the one true Faith.  As we have proven in this book, apostasy from the one true Faith and an acceptance of false gods/idolatrous religions is exactly what most characterizes the Vatican II Counter Church and the Vatican II apostasy.  It has put the demonic “gods” of the pantheon of world religions on a par with the true God of the Catholic Church.</p>
<p>The Whore of Babylon is guilty of spiritual fornication to such an extent that this is the action which characterizes her title - the "great harlot."  By such a description, God is directly contrasting the whore with the Catholic Church; for the Church <strong>is a woman who is characterized by her unwavering fidelity to her Spouse, Jesus Christ</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Pius XI, <em>Mortalium Animos</em> (# 10), Jan. 6, 1928: "During the lapse of centuries, the mystical Spouse of Christ has never been contaminated, nor can she ever in the future be contaminated, as Cyprian bears witness: '<strong>The Bride of Christ cannot be made false to her Spouse</strong>: <strong>she is incorrupt and modest.  She knows but one dwelling, she guards the sanctity of the nuptial chamber chastely and modestly.'"<a id="_ednref13" title="" href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13"><strong>[13]</strong></a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So just as the whore is notorious for her impurity, the Catholic Church is known for her chastity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope St. Siricius, epistle (1) <em>Directa ad decessorem</em> to Himerius, Feb. 10, 385: "And so He has wished the beauty of the Church, whose spouse He is,<strong> to radiate with the splendor of chastity</strong>, so that on the day of judgment, when He will have come again, <strong>He may be able to find her without spot or wrinkle</strong> [Eph. 5:27] as He instituted her through His apostle."<a id="_ednref14" title="" href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14">[14]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Church is "the immaculate Bride of Christ."   The "great harlot" represents nothing but the greatest mockery of the immaculate Bride of Christ in history.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Hadrian I, <em>Second Council of Nicaea</em>, 787: "...<strong>Christ our God, when He took for His Bride</strong> <strong>His Holy Catholic Church, having no blemish or wrinkle,</strong> <strong>promised he would guard her and assured His holy disciples saying, I am with you every day until the consummation of the world."<a id="_ednref15" title="" href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15"><strong>[15]</strong></a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>8. The whore has separated from her Spouse.</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Apocalypse 18:7- "As much as she hath glorified herself, and lived in delicacies, so much torment and sorrow give ye to her; <strong>because she saith in her heart: I sit a queen, and am </strong>no widow; and sorrow I shall not see."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In another amazing verse, the Apocalypse tells us that the whore says to herself, “I sit a queen and am no widow.”  She isn't a widow because her (former) Spouse is not dead.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apocalypse 1:17-18- "And when I had seen him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying: Fear not.  I am the First and the Last, And alive, and was dead, <strong>and behold I am living forever and ever</strong>, and have the keys of death and of hell."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Church’s Spouse is Jesus Christ.  The whore, being <em>a counterfeit Church that has broken from the Catholic Church</em>, therefore had Jesus Christ as her Spouse until she separated herself from Jesus Christ by leaving His traditions and teachings.  Instead of being a faithful spouse, the whore has become her own queen, who is happy imposing on others her own will and glory, her own teachings and religion.</p>
<p>But whereas the whore has separated herself from the Catholic Church by forming a religion and a “Church” of her own, the Bride of Christ – the Catholic Church – always maintains union with Her Spouse, even if most of the world has left her to join the whore.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Pius XII, <em>Mystici Corporis Christi</em> (# 89), June 29, 1943:
"This opinion is false; for <strong>the divine Redeemer is most closely united not only with His Church, which is His beloved Spouse</strong>, but also with each and every one of the faithful, and He ardently desires to speak with them heart to heart, especially after Holy Communion."<a id="_ednref16" title="" href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16">[16]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>9. The light of the lamp shall shine no more in the whore.</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Apocalypse 18:23- "<strong>And the light of the lamp shall shine no more at all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee</strong>: for thy merchants were the great men of the earth, for all nations have been deceived by thy enchantments."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The "light of the lamp" is a reference to the sanctuary lamp found in Catholic churches.  <strong>This lamp signifies Christ's real presence in the Eucharist</strong>.  This lamp can hardly be found in Vatican II churches.  In most cases, it has been moved to the side or to the back of the church.  But more than the displacement of the sanctuary lamp, Apocalypse 18:23 is indicating that Christ's real presence (the valid Eucharist) is no longer found in the Vatican II Church.</p>
<p>"The voice of the bridegroom and the bride" in Apocalypse 18:23 is a reference to Christ and His Church.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Pius XII, <em>Mystici Corporis Christi</em> (# 86), June 29, 1943: "… <strong>he [St. Paul] brings Christ and His Mystical Body into a wonderfully intimate union, he nevertheless distinguishes one from the other <em>as Bridegroom and Bride</em></strong> (Eph. 5:22-23)."<a id="_ednref17" title="" href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17">[17]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If there were any doubt about who the Bridegroom and the Bride are, Pope Pius XII obliterates it by quoting St. Paul.  Jesus Christ is the Bridegroom, and His Mystical Body, the Church, is His immaculate Bride.  When the Apocalypse makes reference to the voice of the Bridegroom and the Bride, it’s another confirmation that the Whore of Babylon is the Vatican II sect – the Counter Church, which has abandoned the teaching (or voice) of the Bridegroom (Jesus Christ) and of the Bride (His Church).</p>
<h3>10. The voice of the pipe is no longer heard in the whore.</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Apocalypse 18:22- <strong>"And the voice of harpers, and of musicians, and of them that play on the pipe, and on the trumpet, shall no more be heard at all in thee</strong>..."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Few people today know that "trumpets and harps were the standard instruments for liturgical music in St. John's day, as organs are today in the west."<a id="_ednref18" title="" href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18">[18]</a>  By including the three primary instruments of Catholic liturgical music throughout history, St. John is warning us that traditional Catholic liturgical music as a whole will "no more be heard at all" in the whore.  And hasn't this come true?</p>
<p>We’ve already shown that since Vatican II, Gregorian chant, our beautiful musical tradition, has been replaced by every type of secular music and instrument under the sun.</p>
<p>It's so bad now that one could enter a modern "Catholic" Church and hear anything from boisterous drums to electric guitars.  One could walk into one of these churches and even be subjected to rock music.  Yet, what's perhaps most disappointing about all of this is that most people don't realize that these modern "Catholic" churches aren't Catholic at all, but belong entirely to the Whore of Babylon.</p>
<h3>11. All the world is drunk with the wine of her whoredom.</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Apocalypse 18:3- "Because all nations have drunk of <strong>the wine of the wrath of her fornication</strong>; and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her."</p>
<p>Apocalypse 14:8- "And another angel followed, saying: That great Babylon is fallen, is fallen; <strong>which made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication</strong>."</p>
<p>Apocalypse 16:19- "And great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give her <strong>the cup of the wine of the indignation of His wrath</strong>."</p>
<p>Apocalypse 17:1-2- "Come, I will shew thee the condemnation of the great harlot, who sitteth upon many waters.  With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication; <strong>and they who inhabit the earth, have been made drunk with the wine of her whoredom</strong>."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Whore of Babylon is condemned repeatedly for fornication having to do with wine.  Why? As we’ve shown, it’s the change to the wine portion of the consecration that renders the New Mass invalid!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope St. Pius V, <em>De Defectibus</em>, chapter 5: "The words of Consecration, which are the form of this Sacrament, are these: <em>For this is my Body</em>.  And: <em>For this is the Chalice of my Blood, of the new and eternal testament: the mystery of faith, which shall be shed for you and for many unto the remission of sins</em>.  <strong>Now if one were to remove, or change anything in the form of the consecration of the Body and Blood, and in that very change of words the [new] wording would fail to mean the same thing, he would not consecrate the Sacrament."</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The reason that the whore is condemned for wine violations is because invalidating changes have been made to the WINE PORTION of the words of consecration in the New Mass.  </strong>See the earlier section on the New Mass for the full discussion.  These changes to the wine portion of the consecration invalidate both consecrations.  The Vatican II Church has truly "<em>made all nations drink</em><em> of the wine</em> of the wrath of her fornication" (Apoc. 14:8).</p>
<h3>12. The whore is drunk with the blood of the saints and martyrs.</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Leo XIII, <em>Au milieu des sollicitudes</em> (#11), Feb. 16, 1892: “[Many times]… <strong>Christians, by the mere fact of their being such, and for no other reason, were forced to choose between apostasy and martyrdom</strong>, being allowed no alternative.”<a id="_ednref19" title="" href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19">[19]</a></p>
<p>Apocalypse 17:6- "<strong>And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus</strong>.  And I wondered when I had seen her, with great admiration."</p>
<p>Apocalypse 18:24- "<strong>And in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints</strong>, and of all that were slain upon the earth."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The whore can be said to be drunk with the blood of the saints on many levels.  The first that comes to mind is ecumenism as it is practiced by the Vatican II sect.  Prior to Vatican II, ecumenism referred to the apostolic endeavor to convert the world to Catholicism.  Today, it refers to the effort to bring all religions together as one without conversion, while respecting all religions as essentially equal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Leo XIII, <em>Custodi Di Quella Fede</em> (# 15), Dec. 8, 1892:
"<strong>Every familiarity should be avoided, not only with those impious libertines who openly promote the character of the sect, but also with those who hide under the mask of universal tolerance, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">respect for all religions</span></strong>, and the craving to reconcile the maxims of the Gospel with those of the revolution.  <strong>These men seek to reconcile Christ and Belial</strong>, the Church of God and the state without God."<a id="_ednref20" title="" href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20">[20]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ecumenism goes directly against the divinely revealed truth that the gods of the non-Catholic religions are devils (Psalm 95:5; 1 Cor. 10:20), and it puts Christ on a level with Lucifer.  Throughout this book we’ve exposed the false ecumenism of the Vatican II sect.  The Vatican II sect considers false religions more or less good and praiseworthy.  Thus, it blasphemes the memory of the saints and martyrs whose flesh was torn with iron hooks, bodies were fed to the lions, and heads were chopped off because they refused to compromise their faith one iota or say that “all religions are more or less good and praiseworthy.”  It also mocks all the sacrifices of all the saints who gave up their lives for the priesthood, for religious life, for missionary work.  All of it was unnecessary, according to the Vatican II sect.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope St. Gregory the Great: <strong>"The holy universal Church teaches that it is not possible to worship God truly except in her</strong> <strong>and asserts that all who are outside of her will not be saved."<a id="_ednref21" title="" href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21"><strong>[21]</strong></a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because Margaret Clitherow refused to accept the Anglican sect and its “Mass” – but rather invited Catholic priests into her home against the penal laws – she was martyred by being crushed to death under a large door loaded with heavy weights.  This style of execution is so painful that it is called “severe and harsh punishment.”  <strong>She suffered it all because she wouldn’t accept Anglicanism</strong>.  The Vatican II sect, however, teaches that Anglicans are fellow “Christians” who don’t need conversion, and whose invalid “bishops” are actually true bishops of the Church of Christ.  The Vatican II sect teaches that her martyrdom was pointless.  It is thus drunk with the blood of the saints and martyrs.</p>
<p>How many martyrs gave their lives for one article of the Catholic faith?  Ecumenism renders their blood-shedding acts worthless, pointless and meaningless.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Leo XIII, <em>Satis Cognitum</em> (# 8), June 29, 1896: "It was thus the duty of all who heard Jesus Christ, if they wished for eternal salvation, not merely to accept His doctrine as a whole,<strong> but to assent with their entire mind to all and every point of it, since it is unlawful to withhold faith from God even in regard to one single point."<a id="_ednref22" title="" href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22"><strong>[22]</strong></a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is why the Vatican II Church is said to be drunk with the blood of martyrs and of saints (Apoc. 17:6; 18:24), and all those who support this antichrist activity now headed by Benedict XVI are drunk as well.</p>
<p>What’s also fascinating is that the Apocalypse mentions that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the martyrs cried out from under the altar</span>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apocalypse 6:9- “And when he had opened the fifth seal, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held.  And they cried out with a loud voice, saying</span>: How long, O Lord (holy and true) dost thou not judge and revenge our blood</strong> on them that dwell on the Earth?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is prescribed that <strong>Catholic Mass is to be said on altars which contain the relics of martyrs</strong>!  Thus, it makes perfect sense that the martyrs, whose lives are being mocked by the Vatican II sect’s ecumenism and endorsement of false religions, are crying out from “under the altar”!  They are crying out not only at the interreligious ecumenism which mocks their lives, but also at the liturgical abominations which occur directly over their relics in the New Mass.  This striking point from Scripture should also show Protestants that the Catholic Church is the one true Church.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apocalypse 18:20, God's Judgment on the Whore- "Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye holy apostles and prophets; for God hath judged your judgment on her."</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 align="center">Conclusion on the Whore of Babylon</h2>
<p>It's quite obvious that the Vatican II sect is the Whore of Babylon prophesied in Scripture.  And contrary to what the Protestant heretics believe, the fact that ecclesiastical Rome's apostasy from the Catholic faith in the last days is predicted in Scripture proves rather than disproves the authenticity of the Catholic Church.  For the tribulation of the last days will be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">one which focuses on deceiving the true faithful</span>, and undermining the true Faith.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apocalypse 11:2- "But the court, which is without the temple, cast out, and measure it not: because it is given unto the Gentiles, <strong>and the holy city they shall tread under foot two and forty months."</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It should be noted that "two and forty months" (Apoc. 11:2), "a thousand two hundred and sixty days" (Apoc. 12:6), and "a time, and times, and half a time" (Apoc. 12:14) and 3 and 1/2 years are regarded by some scholars as symbolic of any period of persecution.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Luke 21:34-35- "And take heed to yourselves, lest perhaps your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness, and the cares of this life, and that day come upon you suddenly.  <strong>For as a snare it shall come upon all that sit upon the face of the whole earth."</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A snare is a device used to catch animals.  Now, if the snare of the last days involves a counterfeit Catholic Church set up from Rome, and a spiritual invasion of the holy city (Rome), then the "animal" that the devil is trying to catch is Traditional Catholicism.  This is another proof that the Catholic religion is the one and only true religion.</p>
<p>It is our hope that this scriptural evidence against the Vatican II Church will strengthen Catholics in their opposition to it.  The biblical prophecies which pinpoint our present situation also enable Catholics to have a better understanding of how God views the developments and events of the last 50 or so years.</p>
<p>But most of all, the Apocalypse uncovers the false resistance to this apostasy, even among the so-called traditionalists, who advocate a position in reference to this harlot church which demands that they remain united to its antipopes and the Vatican II sect.  Such a false "We resist you..." places them right in the very bosom and womb of the harlot.  By their own profession, they are still obstinately united to the "mother of the fornications."  They still confuse the great harlot with the immaculate Bride of Christ.  They still taint a pure and unsullied resistance to the harlot by sticking themselves in the midst of her abominable dominion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apocalypse 18:4-5- "And I heard another voice from heaven, saying: <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Go out from her, my people</span></strong>; that you be not partakers of her sins, and that you receive not of her plagues.  For her sins have reached unto heaven, and the Lord hath remembered her iniquities."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If they don’t completely break with the great harlot, these people will lose their souls in the eternal fire for blaspheming the Church of Christ the King, which has no fellowship with the works of darkness, no part with the unbeliever, and no concord with the woman of iniquity.  Though much of the world has been engulfed by the great harlot, the immaculate Bride of Our Lord still exists in all her purity, though she has been reduced to a remnant and forced underground.  This woman, the remnant Catholic Church in the last days, is described in chapter 12 of the Apocalypse after the vision of the woman clothed with the sun, Our Lady of Fatima.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apocalypse 12:6- "And <strong><em>the woman</em></strong> <strong>fled into the wilderness</strong>, where she had a place prepared by God, that there they should feed her a thousand two hundred and sixty days."</p>
<p>Apocalypse 12:14- "And <strong>there were given to</strong> <strong><em>the woman</em></strong> <strong>two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the desert</strong> unto her place, where she is nourished for a time and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we have not joined already, we must enter this remnant Catholic Church in the wilderness.  We must maintain "the faith once delivered to the saints" (Jude 1:3), and come closer to God by receiving the true sacraments, and practicing devotion to the Immaculate Heart of Mary and the holy rosary.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apocalypse 12:17- "And the dragon was angry against the woman: and went to make war with the rest of her seed, who keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ."</p>
<p>Apocalypse 14:12- "Here is the patience of the saints, who keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus."</p>
