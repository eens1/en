      <description>Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;The File on the positions of the Society of St. Pius X (SSPX) “We are faced with a serious dilemma which, I believe, has never existed in the Church: the one seated on the chair of Peter takes part in the worship of false gods. What conclusions will we have to draw, perhaps in a few months’ time, faced with these repeated acts of taking part in the worship of false religions, I do not know.</description>

      <description>Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;-5/12/06-&#xA;Bishop Tissier De Mallerais of the SSPX recently gave an interview in which he discussed certain issues which are relevant to the post-Vatican II apostasy. I would like to offer a few comments about this interview. Q. “… Zenit.org released a text on 7 April from the French episcopate on the occasion of the end of their plenary assembly which included the following statements: “Truth implies being clear on our points of dissension.</description>

Peter Dimond, O.S.B. -&#xA;As we send out an advertisement for our new video, Why Antipope John Paul II Cannot Be the Pope, we felt that it was appropriate to alert you to a recent (and very serious) event which bears tremendous significance in proving that very point. On Oct. 6, 2002, Antipope John Paul II “solemnly canonized” Josemaria Escriva (b.</description>

      <description>Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;We’ve repeatedly documented that almost all traditionalist priests deny the dogma Outside the Church There is No Salvation. We’ve also documented that among those dogma deniers, the priests of the SSPX are prominent. We’ve also pointed out that almost all of these dogma deniers sometimes make statements which seem to indicate that they hold the dogma; when, in fact, they don’t. All of this was on display in Bishop Bernard Fellay’s recent Conference in Denver, Colorado.</description>

      <description>Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;The Society of St. Pius X (SSPX) recently sent out a newsletter that came to our attention. The newsletter discusses the SSPX’s new seminary project in Virginia. It’s a striking example of the point we made in the recent post on Mel Gibson: i.e., the appalling and diabolical waste of money on heretical groups that is endemic among so-called ‘traditionalists’. The SSPX’s new seminary is being built in Dillwyn, Virginia.</description>

      <description>By Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;Page 216: “Evidently, certain distinctions must be made. Souls can be saved in a religion other than the Catholic religion (Protestantism, Islam, Buddhism, etc.), but not by this religion. There may be souls who, not knowing Our Lord, have by the grace of the good Lord, good interior dispositions, who submit to God...But some of these persons make an act of love which implicitly is equivalent to baptism of desire.</description>

      <title>Baptism of Desire, by Fr. Jean-Marc Rulleau (SSPX)</title>

      <description>By Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;Recently, the Society of St. Pius X (SSPX – Lefebvrists) published two books attacking the teaching of the Church on Baptism. They spend their time trying to figure out ways for people to be saved without baptism – but to no avail. Baptism of Desire by Fr. Jean-Marc Rulleau was published by the SSPX in 1999, while Is Feeneyism Catholic? by Fr. Francois Laisney was published in 2001.</description>

      <description>By Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;Published in 2001, Fr. Laisney’s book was a masterpiece in deceit. There are startling and shockingly dishonest things in his book, which will be exposed in the “Lies” section. HERESY:&#xA;On page 21, Fr. Laisney comments on the necessity of explicit faith in Jesus Christ: “… how much is exactly necessary to know explicitly has not been settled.” This statement clearly implies that it has not been settled whether it is necessary for salvation to believe in the Most Holy Trinity and that Jesus Christ is God and man, which is a denial of the Athanasian Creed, not to mention the teaching of St.</description>

      <description>By Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;Pages 73-74: “Does this mean that no Protestant, no Muslim, no Buddhist or animist will be saved? No, it would be a second error to think that. Those who cry for intolerance in interpreting St. Cyprian’s formula Outside the Church there is no salvation, also reject the Creed, “I accept one baptism for the remission of sins,” and are insufficiently instructed as to what baptism is.</description>

Schmidberger says “it’s clear” that the followers of non-Catholic religions can be saved! No, what is clear is how directly the above statement denies Catholic dogma!</description>
