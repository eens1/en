<h2 align="center"><strong>The File on the positions of the Society of St. Pius X (SSPX</strong>)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>We are faced with a serious dilemma which, I believe, has never existed in the Church: the one seated on the chair of Peter takes part in the worship of false gods</strong>. What conclusions will we have to draw, perhaps in a few months’ time, faced with these repeated acts of taking part in the worship of false religions, I do not know. But I do wonder. <strong>It is possible that we might be forced to believe that the pope is not the pope</strong>.”<a id="_ednref1" title="" href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a> (Archbishop Lefebvre, Sermon, Easter, 1986)<a id="intro" name="intro"></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">[Note</span></strong><strong>: </strong>What is said in this section applies not only to the Society of St. Pius X, but to many other similarly-minded, independent “traditionalist” groups which resist the Vatican II apostasy and the New Mass by holding positions similar to the SSPX.]</p>
<p>The SSPX is a “traditionalist” order of priests founded by the late Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre. Lefebvre was an archbishop in France who resisted many things about the post-Vatican II religion, recognizing them to be departures from traditional Catholicism. He recognized the New Mass to be Protestant and opposed to Tradition. He also opposed the heresies of “ecumenism” and religious liberty, which were taught at Vatican II. He began seminaries for the formation of priests who would be offering exclusively the traditional Mass, and he ordained them in the traditional rite of ordination. In order to do this, he had to remain independent of the Vatican II antipopes, even though he continued to take the position that they were legitimate popes who held the office of the Papacy. He was also independent of the working communion of the “bishops” who had gone along with the new religion. On June 30, 1988, Lefebvre decided (independently of the Vatican II antipopes) to consecrate four bishops in the traditional rite of Episcopal Consecration, so that these bishops could continue to ordain priests for the traditional rites. He was “excommunicated” by John Paul II within 72 hours, even though (as we’ve discussed already) no prominent pro-abortion politician has yet been excommunicated by any of the Vatican II antipopes.</p>
<p>The SSPX has many traditional Mass locations around the world, and is a major force influencing and providing sacraments for those who profess to be traditionalist-minded Catholics. We want to emphasize that the SSPX does many good things; it has been an avenue by which many have been introduced, and come back, to the traditional Catholic Faith. However, in various areas the SSPX’s positions are unfortunately heretical and contrary to the Catholic Faith. First, the SSPX holds and teaches that souls can be saved in non-Catholic religions, which is heretical.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fr. Schmidberger, <em>Time Bombs of the Second Vatican Council</em>, Angelus Press [SSPX], p. 10: “Ladies and gentlemen, <strong>it is clear that the followers of other religions can be saved under certain conditions</strong>, that is to say, if they are in invincible error.”</p>
<p>Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, <em>Against the Heresies</em>, Angelus Press [SSPX], p. 216: “Evidently, certain distinctions must be made. <strong> Souls can be saved in a religion other than the Catholic religion (Protestantism, Islam, Buddhism, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">etc</span>.), </strong>but not by this religion.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These statements constitute blatant heresy against the dogma Outside the Church There is No Salvation; yet they are printed in the very best-selling materials of the SSPX.  In fact, almost all priests who even celebrate the traditional Mass hold this heresy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Gregory XVI, <em>Summo</em><em> Iugiter Studio</em> (# 2), May 27, 1832:<br /><strong>“Finally some of these misguided people attempt to persuade themselves and others that men are not saved only in the Catholic religion, but that even heretics may attain eternal life.”</strong><a id="_ednref2" title="" href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, while resisting the Vatican II apostasy, the SSPX <em>obstinately</em> maintains an allegiance to the manifestly heretical “bishops” of the Novus Ordo/Vatican II Church, as mentioned above. At the same time, however, the SSPX doesn’t operate in communion with what it calls “the New Church” – the Novus Ordo Church – the Church of the Vatican II “bishops” and “popes” (who are actually antipopes). Their position is a contradiction. It’s an affront to Catholic teaching on three counts: 1) They recognize manifest heretics (the Novus Ordo bishops and the Vatican II antipopes) as Catholics who possess authority in the Church, which is heretical They need to recognize that these heretical bishops are outside the Church and have no authority at all.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>St. Robert Bellarmine, <em>De Romano Pontifice</em>, lib. II, cap. 30: “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Finally, the Holy Fathers teach unanimously not only that heretics are outside of the Church, but also that they are "ipso facto" deprived of all ecclesiastical jurisdiction and dignity.</span>”</p>
<p>St. Robert Bellarmine, <em>De Romano Pontifice</em>, II, 30:<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"A pope who is a manifest heretic automatically (<em>per se</em>) ceases to be pope and head</span>, just as he ceases automatically to be a Christian and a member of the Church. Wherefore, he can be judged and punished by the Church. <em>This is the teaching of all the ancient Fathers</em> who teach that manifest heretics immediately lose all jurisdiction."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2) The SSPX <em>obstinately</em> operates outside of communion with the Novus Ordo hierarchy, even though it recognizes it as the Catholic hierarchy. This is actually schismatic. In fact, the SSPX boldly refuses communion with the Novus Ordo Church (see below), even though it recognizes the Novus Ordo hierarchy as the true Catholic hierarchy!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, <em>Declaration</em> of August, 1976:<br />“<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">All those enter into schism who cooperate in this realization of this upheaval and adhere to this new Conciliar Church</span></strong>, as His excellency Bishop Benelli designated it in the letter he addressed to me in the Holy Father’s name last June 25th.” (Quoted in <em>Sacerdotium</em>)</p>
<p>Fr. Franz Schmidberger, former Superior General of the Society of St. Pius X:<br />“<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">We have never wished to belong to this system which calls itself the Conciliar Church</span>, and identifies itself with the Novus Ordo Missae</strong>… <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The faithful indeed have a strict right to know that priests who serve them are not in communion with a counterfeit church</span>.” </strong>(Quoted in <em>Sacerdotium</em>)</p>
<p><em>The Angelus</em>, Official publication of the Society of St. Pius X (SSPX), May, 2000:<br />“This current of renewal <strong>has given birth to a new church within the bosom of the Catholic Church, to that which Msgr. Benelli himself called ‘<em>the conciliar church</em>,’</strong> whose limits and paths are very difficult to define...<strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">It is against this conciliar church that our resistance stands. We do not refuse our adherence to the Pope as such, but to this conciliar church</span></strong>, for its ideas are foreign to those of the Catholic Church.”<a id="_ednref3" title="" href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[3]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To refuse communion with the Novus Ordo Church and not the head of the Novus Ordo Church is like saying that one refuses communion with the Communist Party but not the head of the Communist Party! It’s a contradiction.</p>
<p>Moreover, by its recognition of the Vatican II “popes” and “bishops” as the Catholic hierarchy, the SSPX is in communion with this “counterfeit Church.” At the same time, the SSPX is in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">schism</span> with this “counterfeit Church” because it blatantly refuses communion with the members of this Church, as we see above. (If it sounds contradictory, that’s because it is.) The position is schismatic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Canon 1325.2, <em>1917 Code of Canon Law</em>: “One who after baptism… rejects the authority of the Supreme Pontiff <strong>or refuses communion with the members of the Church who are subject to him, he is a schismatic.”</strong></p>
<p>St. Ignatius of Antioch, <em>Letter to the Trallians</em>, (A.D. 110): “He that is within the sanctuary is pure; but he that is outside the sanctuary is not pure. In other words,<strong> anyone who acts without the bishop and the presbytery and the deacons does not have a clean conscience</strong>.”<a id="_ednref4" title="" href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4">[4]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For decades now, the SSPX has been obstinately working outside of communion with the “bishops” and “pope” it deems to constitute the Catholic hierarchy. This is schismatic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>St. Jerome, <em>Commentaries on the Epistle to Titus</em>, (A.D. 386): “Between heresy and schism there is a distinction made, that heresy involves perverse doctrine, <strong>while schism separates one from the Church on account of disagreement with the Bishop</strong>.”<a id="_ednref5" title="" href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5">[5]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>3) The SSPX holds that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the Catholic Church</span> has become a “New Church,” a modernist sect – a non-Catholic sect which is rife with heresy and apostasy – which is impossible. The Church is the immaculate Bride of Christ, which cannot officially teach error.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Pius XI, <em>Mortalium</em><em> Animos</em> (# 10), Jan. 6, 1928: “During the lapse of centuries, the mystical Spouse of Christ has never been contaminated, nor can she ever in the future be contaminated, as Cyprian bears witness: <strong>‘The Bride of Christ cannot be made false to her Spouse: she is incorrupt and modest. She knows but one dwelling, she guards the sanctity of the nuptial chamber chastely and modestly.’”<a id="_ednref6" title="" href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6"><strong>[6]</strong></a></strong></p>
<p>Pope Pius XI, <em>Quas</em><em> Primas</em> (# 22), Dec. 11, 1925:<br />“Not least among the blessings which have resulted from the public and legitimate honor paid to the Blessed Virgin and the saints is <strong>the perfect and perpetual immunity of the Church from error and heresy.”<a id="_ednref7" title="" href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7"><strong>[7]</strong></a></strong></p>
<p>Pope Pius IX, <em>Vatican Council I</em>, Session 4, Chap. 4, ex cathedra: “… <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">knowing full well that the See of St. Peter always remains unimpaired by any error</span></strong>, according to the divine promise of our Lord the Savior made to the chief of His disciples: ‘I have prayed for thee [Peter], that thy faith fail not: and thou, being once converted, confirm thy brethren’ (Lk. 22:32).”<a id="_ednref8" title="" href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8">[8]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For instance, the SSPX even rejects the solemn canonizations of the Vatican II “popes” it recognizes. This position is terribly schismatic, for it asserts that a true pope and the Catholic Church have officially erred in canonizing saints.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>St. Alphonsus Liguori, <em>The Great Means of Salvation and Perfection</em>, 1759, p. 23: “<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">To suppose that the Church can err in canonizing, is a sin, or is heresy, according to St. Bonaventure, Bellarmine, and others</span></strong>; or at least next door to heresy, according to Suarez, Azorius, Gotti, etc.; because the Sovereign Pontiff,<strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">according to St. Thomas</span>, is guided by the infallible influence of the Holy Ghost in an especial way when canonizing saints.</strong>”<a id="_ednref9" title="" href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9">[9]</a></p>
<p>Pope Benedict XIV: “<strong>If anyone dared to assert that the Pontiff had erred in this or that canonization, we shall say that he is, if not a heretic, at least temerarious, a giver of scandal to the whole Church</strong>, <strong>an insulter of the saints, a favorer of those heretics who deny the Church’s authority in canonizing saints</strong>, savoring of heresy by giving unbelievers an occasion to mock the faithful, the assertor of an erroneous opinion and liable to very grave penalties.”<a id="_ednref10" title="" href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10">[10]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since so many have a high regard for the SSPX, they have been led into the same schismatic position. <strong>All of these false positions on the post-Vatican II situation are a result of the SSPX’s unwillingness to see the truth that the Vatican II sect is a counterfeit Church from top to bottom, and that the post-Vatican II “popes” are actually invalid antipopes</strong>.</p>
<h3 align="center"><strong>Some very interesting statements by Archbishop Lefebvre expressing his view that the Vatican II “popes” might not be valid popes</strong></h3>
<p>No matter how untenable their present position is – nor how clear the evidence in favor of the sedevacantist position – the SSPX continues (even at this late stage in the Vatican II apostasy) to publish books and tracts which attack the sedevacantist position. They fail to realize that the founder of their Society, Archbishop Lefebvre, made numerous statements which demonstrated that he was on the verge of the sedevacantist position back in the 1970’s and 1980’s. These quotations should be known by members of the Society of St. Pius X.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Archbishop Lefebvre, Aug. 4, 1976: “The Council [Vatican II] turned its back on Tradition and broke with the Church of the past. It is a schismatic council… <strong>If we are certain that the Faith taught by the Church for twenty centuries can contain no error, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">we are much less certain that the pope is truly pope</span></strong>. <strong>Heresy, schism, excommunication <em>ipso facto</em>, or invalid election are all causes that can possibly mean the pope was never pope, or is no longer pope</strong>… Because ultimately, since the beginning of Paul VI’s pontificate, the conscience and faith of all Catholics have been faced with a serious problem. How is it that the pope, the true successor of Peter, who is assured of the help of the Holy Ghost, can officiate at the destruction of the Church – the most radical, rapid, and widespread in her history – something that no heresiarch has ever managed to achieve?”<a id="_ednref11" title="" href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11">[11]</a></p>
<p>Archbishop Lefebvre, Sermon, Aug. 29, 1976: “<strong>The new rite of Mass is an illegitimate rite</strong>, the sacraments are illegitimate sacraments, the priests who come from the seminaries are illegitimate priests…”<a id="_ednref12" title="" href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12">[12]</a></p>
<p>Archbishop Lefebvre, Meeting with Paul VI, Sept. 11, 1976: <strong>“[The document of Vatican II on religious liberty] contains passages that are word for word contrary to what was taught by Gregory XVI, and Pius IX</strong>.”<a id="_ednref13" title="" href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13">[13]</a></p>
<p>Archbishop Lefebvre, Sermon, Feb. 22, 1979: “Insofar as it is opposed to Tradition,<strong> we reject the Council [Vatican II].</strong>”<a id="_ednref14" title="" href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14">[14]</a></p>
<p>Archbishop Lefebvre, Sermon, Easter, 1986: “This is the situation in which we find ourselves. I have not created it. I would die to make it go away! <strong>We are faced with a serious dilemma which, I believe, has never existed in the Church: the one seated on the chair of Peter takes part in the worship of false gods</strong>. What conclusions will we have to draw, perhaps in a few months’ time, faced with these repeated acts of taking part in the worship of false religions, I do not know. But I do wonder. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">It is possible that we might be forced to believe that the pope is not the pope</span></strong>. Because it seems to me initially – I do not yet want to say it solemnly and publicly – that it is impossible for a pope to be publicly and formally heretical<strong>.</strong>”<a id="_ednref15" title="" href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15">[15]</a></p>
<p>Archbishop Lefebvre, Sermon, Aug. 27, 1986: “<strong>He who now sits upon the Throne of Peter mocks publicly the first article of the Creed and the first Commandment of the Decalogue [The Ten Commandments]</strong>. The scandal given to Catholics cannot be measured. The Church is shaken to its very foundations.”<a id="_ednref16" title="" href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16">[16]</a></p>
<p>Archbishop Lefebvre, Sermon, Oct. 28, 1986: “<strong>John Paul II has encouraged false religions to pray to their false gods</strong>: it is an unprecedented and intolerable humiliation to those who remain Catholic…”<a id="_ednref17" title="" href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17">[17]</a><a id="OLE_LINK1" name="OLE_LINK1"></a><a id="OLE_LINK2" name="OLE_LINK2"></a><a id="important_articles" name="important_articles"></a></p>
<p>Archbishop Lefebvre, Meeting with “Cardinal” Ratzinger, July 14, 1987: “If there is a schism, it is because of what the Vatican did at Assisi… <strong>being excommunicated by a liberal, ecumenical, and revolutionary Church is a matter of indifference to us</strong>.”<a id="_ednref18" title="" href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18">[18]</a></p>
<p>Archbishop Lefebvre, Meeting with “Cardinal” Ratzinger, July 14, 1987: “<strong>Rome</strong><strong> has lost the Faith. Rome is in apostasy</strong>.”<a id="_ednref19" title="" href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19">[19]</a></p>
<p>Archbishop Lefebvre, Aug. 29, 1987: “<strong>The See of Peter and the posts of authority in Rome being occupied by anti-Christs, </strong>the destruction of the Kingdom of our Lord is being rapidly carried out… This is what has brought down upon our heads persecution by the <strong>Rome</strong><strong> of the anti-Christs</strong>.”<a id="_ednref20" title="" href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20">[20]</a></p>
<p>Archbishop Lefebvre, Declaration given to the Press before 1988 Episcopal Consecrations: “<strong>The Church holds all communion with false religions and heresy</strong>… in horror... <strong>To safeguard the Catholic priesthood which perpetuates the Church and not an adulterous Church</strong>, there must be Catholic bishops.”<a id="_ednref21" title="" href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21">[21]</a></p>
<p>Archbishop Lefebvre, Speaking of the leaders of the Vatican II sect: “<strong>We cannot work together with these enemies of our Lord’s reign</strong>.”<a id="_ednref22" title="" href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22">[22]</a></p>
<p>Archbishop Lefebvre, Speaking of the leaders of the Vatican II sect: “<strong>We cannot follow these people. They’re in apostasy, </strong>they do not believe in the divinity of our Lord Jesus Christ who must reign. What is the use in waiting? Let’s do the consecration!”<a id="_ednref23" title="" href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23">[23]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 align="center">-Some more important points pertaining to the positions of the SSPX are found on our website under the following titles; they are summarized briefly here–</h2>
<h3><strong>Bishop Fellay of the SSPX rejects Catholic dogma by teaching that Hindus can be saved</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Bishop Bernard Fellay, <em>Conference in Denver</em>, <em>Co.</em>, Feb. 18, 2006: “… <strong>And the Church has always taught that you have people who will be in Heaven, who are in the state of grace, who have been saved without knowing the Catholic Church. We know this. And yet, how is it possible if you cannot be saved outside the Church? It is absolutely true that they will be saved through </strong>the Catholic Church because they will be united to Christ, to the Mystical Body of Christ, which is the Catholic Church. It will, however, remain invisible, because this visible link is impossible for them. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Consider a Hindu in Tibet who has no knowledge of the Catholic Church. He lives according to his conscience and to the laws which God has put into his heart. He can be in the state of grace</span></strong>, and if he dies in this state of grace, <strong>he will go to Heaven</strong>.” (<em>The Angelus</em>, “A Talk Heard Round the World,” April, 2006, p. 5.)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>The SSPX rejects John Paul II's "canonization" of Josemaria Escriva, thus revealing its Schism </strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Fr. Peter Scott, Nov. 1, 2002, from SSPX’s Holy Cross Seminary in Australia: “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">A typical example of this was the shameful and highly questionable canonization</span> of Msgr. Josemaria Escriva de Balaguer last October 6… After having pointed out that the process was uncanonical and dishonest, they had this to say: <strong>‘It (the canonization) will offend God</strong>. <strong>It will stain the Church forever. It will take away from the saints their special holiness</strong>. It will call into question the credibility of all the canonizations made during your Papacy. It will undermine the future authority of the Papacy’… <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Their letter will certainly turn out to be prophetic</span>, for in time they will be proven to be right in their assessment concerning Escriva … For all the reasons that they give, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">we cannot possibly consider this ‘canonization’ as a valid, infallible Papal pronouncement</span></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">.</span> We trust that he is in heaven, but we cannot possibly regard as a Saint this herald of Vatican II…” (SOUTHERN SENTINEL - No. 3 - November 2002)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since they recognize that John Paul II was a true pope, to reject his solemn “canonization” is clearly schismatic.</p>
<h3><strong>Bishop Richard Williamson of the SSPX says John Paul II was a “good man” and says the SSPX’s religion is not the same as that of the Vatican II “popes” it recognizes! </strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“A. Bishop Williamson: I was a little surprised, at first, because some people had said he wasn’t really in the running. After that, to tell you the honest truth, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I don’t expect a great deal from Rome as it stands. They are too far gone in the “New Religion,” and the “New Religion” is too radically different and distant from the True Religion</span></strong>. Rome is Rome, though, and I do believe there the popes are, and there are the cardinals, and that is where the official structure of the Church is to be found. But, I’m afraid, for the defense of the Faith, you’ve got to wait for some grave event to shake Rome and/or to drive the true cardinals out of Rome to start again somewhere else. I’m afraid that Rome is too deeply in the grips of the enemies of God. “<a id="_ednref24" title="" href="#_edn24" name="_ednref24">[24]</a></p>

<p>Bishop Williamson of the SSPX boldly states that he doesn’t have the same religion as the “pope” and “bishops” he recognizes as the Catholic hierarchy! This, ladies and gentlemen, sums up the completely ridiculous – and schismatic – position of the SSPX, which is (for lack of a better description) so obstinately inconsistent that it is correctly labeled <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THEOLOGICAL PUKE</span></strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Pius XII, <em>Mystici</em><em> Corporis Christi</em> (# 22):<br />“As therefore <strong>in the true Christian community</strong> there is only one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, and one Baptism, so <strong>there can be only one faith</strong>. And therefore if a man refuse to hear the Church let him be considered – so the Lord commands – as a heathen and a publican. It follows that <strong>those who are divided in faith or government cannot be living in the unity of such a Body</strong>, nor can they be living the life of its one Divine Spirit.”<a id="_ednref25" title="" href="#_edn25" name="_ednref25">[25]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>Bishop Tissier De Mallerais of the SSPX rejects the concept of Church communion and says Benedict XVI has taught heresies </strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“A. Bishop Tissier De Mallerais: “Firstly, I am not familiar with this text. I do not know it. It is not interesting to me as I do not follow such news. That is not the problem here. <strong>The problem is not “communion.” That is the stupid idea of these bishops since Vatican II – there is not a problem of communion</strong>, there is a problem of the profession of faith. “Communion” is nothing, it is an invention of the Second Vatican Council. <strong>The essential thing is that these people (the bishops) do not have the Catholic Faith</strong>. “Communion” does not mean anything to me – it is a slogan of the new Church. <strong>The definition of the new Church is “communion” but it was never the definition of the Catholic Church</strong>. I can only give you the definition of the Church as it has been understood traditionally.”</p>
<p>“A. Bishop Tissier De Mallerais: It was when he was a priest. When he was a theologian, he professed heresies, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">he published a book full of heresies</span></strong>… Yes, sure. <strong>He has a book called <em>Introduction to Christianity</em></strong>, it was in 1968. <strong>It is a book full of heresies. Especially the negation of the dogma of the Redemption</strong>.”<a id="_ednref26" title="" href="#_edn26" name="_ednref26">[26]</a></p>
<p>Pope Leo XIII, <em>Satis</em><em> Cognitum</em> (# 10), June 29, 1896: "For this reason, as the unity of faith is of necessity for the unity of the Church, inasmuch as it is the body of the faithful, so also for this same unity, inasmuch as the Church is a divinely constituted society, unity of government, which effects and involves <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">unity of communion, is necessary <em>jure divino</em></span></strong> (by divine law)."<a id="_ednref27" title="" href="#_edn27" name="_ednref27">[27]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It makes sense that the SSPX (or, at least Bishop Tissier De Mallerais) would not believe in the concept of <em>being in communion with all in the Church</em>. “Communion means nothing to me,” Bishop Tissier De Mallerais says. Yes, we can all see that very well. Since he doesn’t believe in it, refusing communion with the hierarchy and members of what he deems to be the Catholic Church is obviously not a conscience-problem.</p>
<h3 align="center">The Society of St. Pius X’s book <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Most Asked Questions about the Society of St. Pius X</span></em>says the Vatican II “popes” CANNOT teach infallibly</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Most Asked Questions about the Society of St. Pius X</em>, Question 7: But shouldn’t we be following John Paul II?, pp. 38-40: “<strong>The Pope is infallible</strong> primarily in matters of faith and morals, and secondarily in matters of discipline (legislation for the Universal Church, canonizations, etc.) to the extent that these involve faith and morals (cf. Principle 4), and then <strong>only when imposing for all time a definitive teaching</strong>.</p>
<p>“<strong>Now ‘infallible’ means immutable and irreformable (Principle 6), but, the hallmark of the conciliar Popes, like the Modernists, is a spirit of evolution. To what extent can such minds want irreformably to define or absolutely to impose? <span style="text-decoration: underline;">They do not and, in fact, ‘they cannot</span></strong>…’ (Archbishop Lefebvre, Econe, June 12, 1984.) Cf. Question 15, n. 3.” (Angelus Press, 1997)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Society of St. Pius X is not merely stating here that John Paul II did not fulfill the requirements to speak infallibly; the SSPX (writing during the reign of John Paul II) stated that he (the man they considered to be the true pope) <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cannot</span></em></strong> speak infallibly.</p>
<p>For those who are for some reason not grasping the impact of this statement by the SSPX, allow us to summarize it: the SSPX correctly points out that an infallible teaching by a pope on faith or morals is irreformable, as Vatican I declared (Denz. 1839). But according to the SSPX, the Vatican II “popes” are such Modernists that they believe in the evolution of doctrine; they don’t believe that anything is irreformable. So, according to the SSPX, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">even though they are valid popes</span>, the post-conciliar “popes” <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CANNOT</span></strong> teach infallibly! This is a rejection of the dogma of Papal Infallibility.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Pius IX, <em>Vatican Council I</em>, 1870, Session 4, Chap. 4:<br />“…<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the Roman Pontiff, when he speaks ex cathedra</span></strong> [from the Chair of Peter], that is, when carrying out the duty of the pastor and teacher of all Christians in accord with his supreme apostolic authority he explains a doctrine of faith or morals to be held by the universal Church... <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">operates with that infallibility</span></strong> with which the divine Redeemer wished that His Church be instructed in defining doctrine on faith and morals… <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">But if anyone presumes to contradict this definition of Ours, which may God forbid: let him be anathema</span></strong>.”<a id="_ednref28" title="" href="#_edn28" name="_ednref28">[28]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>By definition, a pope is the Bishop of Rome who possesses supreme jurisdiction in the Church and who CAN teach infallibly, if he fulfills the requisite conditions. If he is incapable of speaking infallibly, he is therefore not a valid pope!</p>
<p>All of these schismatic positions (e.g, the SSPX’s rejection of “canonizations” proclaimed by their “pope”) and perversions of the Papal Office are a result of the SSPX’s failure to see the truth of the sedevacantist position (i.e., that the Vatican II “popes” are not popes at all, but antipopes).</p>
<h2 align="center">Benedict XVI personally tells SSPX that it must accept Vatican II</h2>
<p>In his <em>Conference in Denver </em>in 2006 (carried in an article in <em>The Angelus</em>), Bishop Fellay of the SSPX mentioned a very important point. He admitted that, in his personal meeting with Antipope Benedict XVI, the antipope made it very clear to him that the SSPX must accept Vatican II.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bishop Bernard Fellay, <em>Conference in Denver</em>, Feb. 18, 2006: “Then he [Benedict XVI] went to the second level. And he said that the second level is the acceptance of the Council… <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Pope clearly indicated in the words he used during the audience, that for him, it is impossible to accept someone in the Church, at least in his, let’s say, modern way of looking at the Church, who would not accept the Council</span></strong>. He was very clear. When I heard these words there, and especially one word afterwards, for me, the big fight we will have under this pontificate will be the fight about the Council.”<a id="_ednref29" title="" href="#_edn29" name="_ednref29">[29]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>How many times does this have to be proven? The false traditionalists need to give up their impossible position, according to which it’s acceptable to reject Vatican II and accept the Vatican II “popes” as legitimate. They must reject Vatican II <em>and</em> the non-Catholic antipopes who enforced it.</p>
<h3 align="center">Important points regarding the claim of SSPX supporters – and those who hold similar positions – that they just live a Catholic life, attend the SSPX (or some other independent chapel) and don’t get involved with these issues, such as sedevacantism</h3>
<p>We frequently hear from people, especially supporters of the SSPX, that they are just laypeople who cannot get involved in these theological issues, such as the sedevacantist issue. They just go to Mass at the SSPX, support them and try to be good, spiritual people who live the Faith. This is the response of many SSPX supporters when confronted by sedevacantist arguments.</p>
<p>Okay, if that’s the case – if you don’t have the authority to get involved with these issues and you are just a “simple layman who goes to Mass” and tries to live the Catholic Faith – THEN YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO ATTEND THE SSPX OR ANOTHER INDEPENDENT CHAPEL.</p>
<p>IF YOU ARE TOO SIMPLE TO “FIGURE THIS STUFF OUT” AND YOU CANNOT GET INVOLVED WITH THESE ISSUES – IF THAT IS YOUR POSITION (WHICH GOD FORBID) – THEN LOGICALLY YOU WOULD HAVE TO SIMPLY ACCEPT YOUR LOCAL NOVUS ORDO CHURCH, GO TO THE NEW MASS, AND ACCEPT VATICAN II, WHICH IS THE RELIGION APPROVED BY THE LOCAL NOVUS ORDO “BISHOP.” But “no,” the would-be “simple” layman who “<em>just goes to the SSPX</em> <em>and tries to live a good life</em>” and doesn’t get involved in “these issues” <strong>all of a sudden gets involved in the issues and becomes a “theologian.”</strong> <strong>He “knows” that he cannot accept the New Mass and his local Novus Ordo religion</strong>. He thus condemns himself out of his own mouth, refutes his own argument and shows his hypocrisy <em>by only “getting involved” where he wants to get involved</em>.</p>
<p>For the bottom-line is that if one can accept the New Mass and Vatican II religion <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and save his soul</span> then there is no justification whatsoever for going to an independent chapel or the SSPX. It’s all a matter of preference, in that case. <strong>But if one holds that Faith obliges him to reject the New Mass and the Vatican II religion as something which will cause the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">loss</span> of his salvation (which is the truth), then the local church and the New Mass (and the authorities who imposed it) cannot represent the Catholic Church</strong>. That leads one inescapably to the sedevacantist position, for the Holy Catholic Church does not lead us to Hell.</p>
<p>All of this hopefully shows us again that the only Catholic position is, of course, the sedevacantist position, and that all the other false positions are inconsistent with Catholic teaching. Since the SSPX promotes heretical positions which are inconsistent with Catholic teaching, no Catholic can financially support them under pain of mortal sin.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Innocent III, <em>Fourth Lateran Council</em>, 1215: "<strong>Moreover, we determine to subject to excommunication believers who receive, defend, or <span style="text-decoration: underline;">support heretics</span></strong><strong>."<a id="_ednref30" title="" href="#_edn30" name="_ednref30"><strong>[30]</strong></a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 align="center">Quick Thoughts on a Possible Reunion of the SSPX completely with the New Church</h3>
<p>At the time this book is being finalized (2007), there is some talk that the SSPX will enter into full communion with the Vatican II sect, in exchange for Antipope Benedict XVI’s wider permission for the Latin Mass and a possible lifting of the excommunications against their society. If this occurs, this will represent a complete selling out by the SSPX to the Counter Church. Benedict XVI, being guided by the Devil, is well aware that, at this point, the apostasy of the Vatican II sect is so firmly in place, <em>and almost all of the priests are invalid since they were ordained in the New Rites of Paul VI</em>, that he can afford to make concessions to traditionalist-minded groups in order to lure them back into the Counter Church whereby they will be completely denying Christ by full acceptance of the new religion and things such as a “canonization” of the apostate John Paul II.</p>
<p>If Benedict XVI does make a deal of this type with the SSPX, don’t be deceived; it will be a tactical move by the Devil to attempt to deceive traditionalists at this late stage of the Great Apostasy. If this does occur, we think it would result in the fracture of the SSPX into factions pro and con the full reunion with the Counter Church.</p>
