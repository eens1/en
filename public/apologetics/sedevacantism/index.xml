      <description>Brother Michael Dimond and Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;The Catholic Encyclopedia, “Heresy,” 1914, Vol. 7, p. 261: “The pope himself, if notoriously guilty of heresy, would cease to be pope because he would cease to be a member of the Church.”[1]&#xA;Heresy is the obstinate denial or doubt by a baptized person of an article of divine and Catholic Faith.&amp;nbsp; In other words, a baptized person who deliberately denies an authoritative teaching of the Catholic Church is a heretic.</description>
