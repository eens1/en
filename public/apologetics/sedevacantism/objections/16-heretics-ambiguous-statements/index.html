<p><em>2007/01/19</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Chris Ferrara, <em>Catholic Family News</em>, “Opposing the Sedevacantist Enterprise, Part II,” Oct. 2005, p. 8: “<strong>Now that which is manifest – i.e., plain, evident, obvious, unmistakable and undoubted – <u>requires no explanation</u></strong>.  The very quality of not needing to be explained is what makes a thing manifest.  Thus, before the Enterprise can even get to first base, it must show us not merely papal statements made openly, but statements whose alleged heresy requires no explanation to demonstrate.  <strong>The papal words themselves – not sedevacantist <em>interpretations</em> of those words – must denote heresy</strong>.</p>
<p>     “<strong>If a Pope were to proclaim to the whole Church in some document or public pronouncement ‘There is no Holy Trinity.  There is only God the Creator, just as the Muslims believe!’ his heresy would be manifest in the full and correct sense of the word</strong>.”<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Answer:  The one making this objection, Chris Ferrara, is completely wrong, as usual.  First, there are many examples of manifest heresies from the post-conciliar antipopes which require no explanation or commentary, as we have seen.  Second, papal authority teaches us that some heresies do require explanation, deep study and analysis to uncover and condemn, as we will also see.</p>
<p>Before we expand on those two points, it is necessary for the reader to examine the example of heresy that Ferrara gives.  Ferrara gives the example of heresy: “There is no Holy Trinity.”  According to Ferrara, this is an undeniable example of manifest heresy.  He is correct that this statement is heretical, but notice that <strong>even in this example we are not dealing with an exact <em>word-for-word</em> denial of a dogmatic definition</strong>.  As far as we’re aware, there is no dogmatic definition on the Holy Trinity which states “There is a Holy Trinity.”  There are definitions, such as the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Gregory X, <em>Council of Lyons II</em>, 1274, ex cathedra: “<strong>We believe that the Holy Trinity, the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, is one God omnipotent</strong>…”<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, Catholics immediately recognize that the statement “There is no Holy Trinity” <em>equates</em> to a direct denial of this dogmatic definition, even though it doesn’t deny the dogmatic definition<em> verbatim</em>.  So, <strong>in giving his single example of heresy</strong> – a single example Ferrara probably concocted because he feels confident that that the sedevacantists can produce no equivalent heresy on the Trinity from Benedict XVI – <strong>Ferrara proves our point: statements that equate to a direct denial of dogma, even though they are not <u>exact word-for-word</u> denials of a dogmatic definition, are examples of manifest heresy</strong>.</p>
<p>So, just as Catholics immediately recognize that the statement “There is no Holy Trinity” is a manifest heresy, even though there is no dogma declaring <em>exactly the opposite word-for-word</em>, they likewise immediately recognize that Benedict XVI’s declaration that <strong>Protestantism is not heresy</strong> is, of course, a direct denial of the Catholic dogmas which condemn Protestant teachings as heresies.  Thank you for proving our point again, Mr. Ferrara.</p>
<p>We will now quote more than 10 statements from Benedict XVI (and just one from John Paul II) and give no commentary whatsoever.  Everyone who is sincere and honest will see that they equate to direct rejections of Catholic dogma without any analysis being required.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Cardinal” Joseph Ratzinger, <em>The Meaning of Christian Brotherhood</em>, pp. 87-88: “The difficulty in the way of giving an answer is a profound one.  Ultimately it is due to the fact that <strong><u>there is no appropriate category in Catholic thought for the phenomenon of Protestantism today</u></strong><u> (one could say the same of the relationship to the separated churches of the East).  <strong>It is obvious that the old category of ‘heresy’ is no longer of any value</strong></u><strong>… Protestantism has made an important contribution to the realization of Christian faith, fulfilling a positive function</strong> in the development of the Christian message… <strong><u>The conclusion is inescapable, then: Protestantism today is something different from heresy in the traditional sense, a phenomenon whose true theological place has not yet been determined</u></strong>.”<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[3]</a></p>

<p>There are <u>many</u> others, but these constitute more than ten examples of manifest heresies which equate to a direct denial of Catholic dogma without any commentary being necessary.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>CHRIS FERRARA VS. POPE PIUS VI ON AMBIGUITY IN HERESY = A KNOCKOUT FOR POPE PIUS VI</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the fact that there are manifest heresies which require no commentary from the Vatican II antipopes, as we saw above, <strong>WHAT UTTERLY DESTROYS FERRARA’S POINT is the fact that Pope Pius VI teaches exactly the opposite of Ferrara on heresy and ambiguity.  Pope Pius VI declares that heretics, such as Nestorius, have always camouflaged their heresies and doctrinal errors in self-contradiction and ambiguity!</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Pius VI, condemning the Synod of Pistoia, Bull “Auctorem fidei," August 28, 1794: <strong>“[The Ancient Doctors] knew the capacity of innovators in the art of deception.</strong>  In order not to shock the ears of Catholics, they sought to hide the subtleties of their tortuous maneuvers by the use of seemingly innocuous words such as would allow them to insinuate error into souls in the most gentle manner.  Once the truth had been compromised, they could, by means of slight changes or additions in phraseology, distort the confession of the faith which is necessary for our salvation, and lead the faithful by subtle errors to their eternal damnation.  This manner of dissimulating and lying is vicious, regardless of the circumstances under which it is used.  For very good reasons it can never be tolerated in a synod of which the principal glory consists above all in teaching the truth with clarity and excluding all danger of error.</p>
<p>"Moreover, if all this is sinful, <strong><u>it cannot be excused</u> in the way that one sees it being done, <u>under the erroneous pretext that the seemingly shocking affirmations in one place are further developed along orthodox lines in other places</u></strong><u>, <strong>and even in yet other places corrected</strong></u><strong>; <u>as if allowing for the possibility of either affirming or denying the statement</u>, or of leaving it up to the personal inclinations of the individual – <u>such has always been the fraudulent and daring method used by innovators to establish error</u>. <u>It allows for both the possibility of promoting error and of excusing it</u>.</strong></p>
<p>"It is as if the innovators pretended that they always intended to present the alternative passages, especially to those of simple faith who eventually come to know only some part of the conclusions of such discussions which are published in the common language for everyone's use.  Or again, as if the same faithful had the ability on examining such documents to judge such matters for themselves without getting confused and avoiding all risk of error.  <strong>It is a most reprehensible technique for the insinuation of doctrinal errors and one condemned long ago by our predecessor Saint Celestine who found it used in the writings of Nestorius, Bishop of Constantinople, and which he exposed in order to condemn it with the greatest possible severity.  Once these texts were examined carefully, the impostor was exposed and confounded, for he expressed himself in a plethora of words, <u>mixing true things with others that were obscure</u></strong>; <strong><u>mixing at times one with the other in such a way that he was also able to confess those things which were denied while at the same time possessing a basis for denying those very sentences which he confessed</u></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>"In order to expose such snares, something which becomes necessary with a certain frequency in every century, no other method is required than the following: <u>WHENEVER IT BECOMES NECESSARY TO EXPOSE STATEMENTS WHICH DISGUISE SOME SUSPECTED ERROR OR DANGER UNDER THE VEIL OF AMBIGUITY, ONE MUST DENOUNCE THE PERVERSE MEANING UNDER WHICH THE ERROR OPPOSED TO CATHOLIC TRUTH IS CAMOUFLAGED</u>.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pope Pius VI teaches us that if someone veils a heresy in ambiguity, as heretics have done throughout the ages, a Catholic must hold him to the heretical meaning and denounce the heretical meaning which is camouflaged in ambiguity!<strong>  This alone blows Chris Ferrara’s entire series of articles and objections against sedevacantism out of the water</strong>.  (And please note an important distinction: we are not asserting that documents or statements that are merely ambiguous, but which teach no clear doctrinal contradiction of Catholic Faith, are heretical; no, we are asserting with Pope Pius VI that documents which contain heretical statements or assertions which <u>clearly</u> contradict Catholic dogma (“shocking affirmations,” according to Pius VI) but which <em>also</em> contain self-contradiction and ambiguity along with those heretical statements, are still just as heretical despite the ambiguity and self-contradiction that accompanies the heresy.  An example would be an alleged “Catholic” who consistently supports abortion, but sometimes says that he accepts Church teaching on abortion.  This person is a manifest heretic, despite the self-contradiction and ambiguity that his position implies.  Another example would be a man who states that we shouldn’t convert Protestants (a manifest heresy), but who also states that the Catholic Church alone is the fullness of the Christian Faith which all should embrace.  He is a manifest heretic, despite the fact that the latter statement seems to some to contradict the former statement.  Heretics are dishonest and liars, so they often attempt to contradict or mitigate the offensiveness of their heresies through subtle tactics of self-contradiction and accompanying ambiguity; that is the point of Pope Pius VI.)</p>
<p>Notice how directly Chris Ferrara contradicts the teaching of Pope Pius VI.</p>

<p>Obviously, Pope Pius VI is correct and Chris Ferrara is completely wrong.  Notice that Pius VI also says that some of these doctrinal errors (<strong>which are also <u>heresies</u> in this case, since he is referring to the <em><u>heresies</u></em> of the <em>arch-heretic</em> Nestorius</strong>) were <u>only uncovered through careful study and analysis</u>!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pius VI: “It is a most reprehensible technique for the insinuation of doctrinal errors and one condemned long ago by our predecessor Saint Celestine who found it used in the writings of Nestorius, Bishop of Constantinople, and which he exposed in order to condemn it with the greatest possible severity.  <strong><u>Once these texts were examined carefully</u></strong>, <strong>the impostor was exposed and confounded</strong>, for he expressed himself in a plethora of words, <u>mixing true things with others that were obscure</u>; <u>mixing at times one with the other in such a way that he was also able to confess those things which were denied while at the same time possessing a basis for denying those very sentences which he confessed</u>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But we thought that such analysis and study wouldn’t be needed for manifest contradictions of Catholic teaching?  That’s what Chris Ferrara said. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Chris Ferrara, <em>The Remnant</em>, Sept. 30, 2005, p. 18: “…where are the objectively heretical statements?  If they exist, it should be a simple matter to quote the heretical propositions uttered… <strong><u>The ‘heresies’ should speak for themselves without any helpful ‘commentary’ by sedevacantist accusers</u></strong><u>.</u>”<a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15">[15]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chris Ferrara couldn’t be more wrong.  Heretics deceive through contradictions and ambiguity because heresy itself is a lie and a contradiction.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Pius XI, <em>Rite expiatis</em> (# 6), April 30, 1926: “…<strong><u>heresies gradually arose and grew in the vineyard of the Lord, propagated either by open heretics or by sly deceivers</u></strong> who, because they professed a certain austerity of life and gave a false appearance of virtue and piety, easily led weak and simple souls astray.”<a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16">[16]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice, <strong><u>heresies</u></strong> arise both through open and undeceiving heretics as well as by <u>sly deceivers, such as Benedict XVI</u>, who mixes in conservative statements and actions among his astounding and undeniable heresies.  Illustrating this point again is the fact that the arch-heretic Arius got himself approved by Constantine by giving him an <u>ambiguous</u> profession of faith.  St. Athanasius was not fooled, however, and refused to consider him a Catholic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>Arius presented himself</strong> with Euzoios, his ally in doctrine and exile.  <strong><u>He left with the Emperor [Constantine] a wary profession of Faith which could be interpreted either in the Arian or the orthodox sense but which did not contain the word ‘consubstantial</u>.’  Constantine was content, revoked his sentence of exile, and ordered that Arius should be readmitted to his rank in the clergy.  Arius’ ecclesiastical superior, <u>Athanasius, however, refused to accept him</u></strong>.”<a href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17">[17]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to Chris Ferrara, Catholics should have accepted the Christ-denier Arius as a Catholic, as Constantine did, since his profession was ambiguous.  <strong>Chris Ferrara is the perfect dupe of Satan; all the Devil needs to have the heretic do after teaching his heresy is spice in a little ambiguity, and pepper in a little contradiction, and he will be telling the world to follow the heretic and remain under his aegis</strong>.  And that is exactly <u>how</u> the Devil has been so successful in keeping people in the apostate, manifestly heretical Vatican II sect.  People see a few conservative statements or actions from the heretics, and they convince themselves that they couldn’t be malicious heretics, even though they are denying and destroying the Faith all around them, as we’ve shown.  In this way, the Devil wins.</p>
<p>To further illustrate the “patent absurdity” of Chris Ferrara’s “theology” John Doe could write a document which denies that Our Lady is immaculate over and over again, and then state at the end that he upholds Church teaching on the Immaculate Conception, and the document wouldn’t be manifestly heretical because it contains “self-contradiction.”  Could anything be more stupid?  Ferrara applies this false theology, which is directly contrary to the teaching of Pope Pius VI (as we saw above), to his analysis of Vatican II’s Declaration on Religious Liberty.</p>

<p>Chris Ferrara, <em>Catholic Family News</em>, “Opposing the Sedevacantist Enterprise, Part II,” Oct. 2005, p. 25: “<strong>The [Sedevacantist] Enterprise’s claim of manifest heresy </strong>in DH [<em>Dignitatis Humanae</em>, Vatican II’s Declaration on Religious Liberty]<strong> <u>becomes even weaker when one considers that Article 1 of DH states that the Council ‘leaves untouched traditional Catholic doctrine</u> on the moral duty of men and societies toward the true religion and toward the one Church of Christ</strong>.’”<a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18">[18]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Vatican II’s Declaration on Religious Liberty contains clear heresy against the Church’s dogma that the State has the right to repress the public expression of false religions.  The fact that Vatican II’s Declaration on Religious Liberty claims to “leave untouched traditional Catholic doctrine” means absolutely nothing.  The “Old Catholics” said exactly the same, as did heretics throughout history.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Pius IX, <em>Graves ac diuturnae</em> (# 2), March 23, 1875: “<strong>They [the ‘Old Catholics’] repeatedly state openly that they do not in the least reject the Catholic Church</strong> and its visible head <strong><u>but rather that they are zealous for the purity of Catholic doctrine</u></strong>…  But in fact they refuse to acknowledge all the divine prerogatives of the vicar of Christ on earth and do not submit to His supreme Magisterium.”<a href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19">[19]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to Ferrara, then, the case that the “Old Catholics” are heretics is invalid, for they repeatedly state that they are zealous for the purity of Catholic doctrine, and they openly declare that they don’t reject Catholic teaching.  But no, the Catholic Church teaches that they are manifest heretics, and all who adhere to their teachings and sect are considered heretics.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Pius IX, <em>Graves ac diuturnae</em> (#'s 1-4), March 23, 1875: "… the new heretics who call themselves 'Old Catholics'... these schismatics and heretics... their wicked sect... these sons of darkness... their wicked faction… this deplorable sect… This sect overthrows the foundations of the Catholic religion, shamelessly rejects the dogmatic definitions of the Ecumenical Vatican Council, and devotes itself to the ruin of souls in so many ways.  <strong>We have decreed and declared in Our letter of 21 November 1873 that <u>those unfortunate men who belong to, adhere to, and support that sect should be considered as schismatics and separated from communion with the Church</u></strong>." <a href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20">[20]</a></p>
<p>Pope Pius IX, <em>Quartus Supra</em> (# 6), Jan. 6, 1873: “It has always been the custom of heretics and schismatics to call themselves Catholics and to proclaim their many excellences in order to lead people and princes into error.” <a href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21">[21]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can see that Chris Ferrara’s “theology” is directly at variance with not only the teaching of the popes, but common sense.  In fact, the satanic idiocy of Ferrara’s (and many others’) position – that the Vatican II apostates and antipopes are not manifest heretics because they sometimes contradict themselves and employ ambiguity along with their astounding heresies – is perhaps best exemplified by looking at the case of the apostate John Kerry. </p>
<p>We would doubt that almost anyone reading this article believes that John Kerry is a Catholic.  Even the people at Franciscan University admit that: “<strong>You cannot be a Catholic and be pro-abortion</strong>,” as their signs declared in protest when he spoke in Ohio.  <strong>But John Kerry states that he accepts Catholic teaching</strong>, even though he consistently votes in favor of abortion. </p>
<p>During the 2004 Presidential Debate with George W. Bush, John Kerry stated: “<strong>I cannot impose <u>my</u> article of faith on someone else</strong>.”  Did you get that?  John Kerry has stated publicly that the Church’s teaching against abortion is <u>his</u> article of faith, but that he simply cannot apply that or impose that in the public sphere.  His argument is absurd, a lie, <u>a contradiction</u>, of course – as all heresies are.  But according to Chris Ferrara, John Kerry must be considered a Catholic, for something that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p> “<strong>… <u>contradicts itself by appearing to uphold and negate the traditional teaching at one and the same time can hardly be said to constitute a manifest contradiction of the traditional teaching</u></strong>…”<a href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22">[22]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can see that this statement is pure nonsense.  If it were true, then John Kerry can hardly be said to be a manifest heretic when he publicly affirms that Church teaching against abortion is <u>his</u> article of faith, but contradicts that by adamantly supporting abortion.  John Kerry must be considered a Catholic, according to the despicable perversion of Catholic teaching, inspired by Satan, that the heretic Chris Ferrara is peddling in “traditional” publications.  This conclusion would also put Ferrara at variance with another of his colleagues and good friends, Michael Matt, who declared unequivocally (on his own authority, since this has not been declared by his “pope”) that John Kerry is an apostate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Michael Matt, <em>The Remnant</em>, April 15, 2004, p. 5: <strong>“Take Senator John F. Kerry, for example, the first Catholic nominated for the presidency by either major party since 1960.</strong>  Kerry, whose paternal grandparents were Jewish, by the way, is doing a remarkably good Kennedy impersonation these days: ‘We have a separation of Church and state in this country,’ Kerry recently told <em>Time</em> magazine.  ‘As John Kennedy said very clearly, I will be a President who happens to be Catholic, not a Catholic president.’  On that, at least, we can agree with the gentleman from Massachusetts!  <strong><u>In fact, we would take it one step further by noting that presidential candidate Kerry isn’t Catholic at all.</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>     <u>“Oh, yes, the former altar boy says he’s Catholic; he allegedly complains when his staff doesn’t leave adequate time on his schedule for Sunday Mass; his official web site announces that ‘John Kerry was raised in the Catholic faith and continues to be an active member of the Catholic church.’  But he’s not Catholic, and neither is his wife</u></strong> – another anti-Catholic who claims to be a practicing one.  John Kerry’s description of himself and his wife is simply untrue: ‘[I’m a] believing and practicing Catholic, married to another believing and practicing Catholic.’  Sounds nice.  Trouble is, <strong><u>John Kerry is an apostate</u></strong>.’”<a href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23">[23]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems that Ferrara and Matt have some talking to do.  And really, the case of John Kerry proves the point, for if you cannot say that Benedict XVI, who takes active part in Jewish worship, doesn’t believe that Jesus is necessarily the Messiah and Son of God, teaches that we shouldn’t convert Protestants, was initiated into Islam, etc. can’t be considered a heretic – then you have no justification whatsoever to label John Kerry one.  In fact, the dogmas that Benedict XVI denies have been defined far more times than the dogma that Kerry denies.</p>
