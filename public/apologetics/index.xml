      <description>Source: Washbourne 1882, pp .248-249.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Act bravely, my Brethren ; take courage, and trust in the Lord. The time is fast approaching in which there will be great trials and afflictions; perplexities and dissensions, both spiritual and temporal, will abound; the charity of many will grow cold, and the malice of the wicked will increase.&#xA;The devils will have unusual power, the immaculate purity of our Order, and of others, will be so much obscured that there will be very few Christians who will obey the true Sovereign Pontiff and the Roman Church with loyal hearts and perfect charity.</description>

      <title>Against Islam</title>

      <description>Islam considers Jesus to be a prophet, but denies His divinity. Yet Jesus Himself claimed on numerous occasions that He is God (John 8:58, John 10:30, John 14:6, etc.). If Jesus was not God, then claiming to be God when He is not would make Him a false prophet. This proves that Islam is a false religion and that its teaching is patently illogical.</description>
