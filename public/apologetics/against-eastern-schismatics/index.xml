      <description>By Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;The Catholic Church also teaches that those baptized persons who embrace heretical or schismatic sects will lose their souls. Jesus founded His Church upon St. Peter, as we saw already, and declared that whoever does not hear the Church be considered as the heathen and publican (Matthew 18:17). He also commanded His followers to observe “all things whatsoever” He has commanded (Matthew 28:20). The Eastern schismatic sects (such as the “Orthodox”) and the Protestant sects are breakoff movements that have separated from the Catholic Church.</description>

      <title>God&#39;s Eternity &amp; Immutability - Denied By Eastern “Orthodox” Speakers</title>

      <description>By Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;The truth that God is eternal is a basic dogma of Christianity. Sophronius of Jerusalem, Synodical Letter, approved by III Council of Constantinople: “… the one God, Father, Son, Holy Spirit – that is, the nature which is eternal and without beginning…” (Sophronius Of Jerusalem And Seventh-Century Heresy, Oxford Univ. Press, p. 119.)&#xA;God’s eternity not only means that He is without beginning or end but also without before or after.</description>

      <title>Greek “Orthodoxy” Gregory Palamas Is Not A Saint &amp; He Was Condemned Before</title>

      <description>By Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;We’ve produced videos that refute Eastern ‘Orthodoxy’ and its false doctrine known as Palamism. Palamism is the heretical idea that in God there’s a real distinction between His essence and “uncreated energies.” It comes from Gregory Palamas. Palamas is considered to be a saint in various sects of Eastern “Orthodoxy”, but he is not considered to be a saint by the true Church, the Catholic Church, as we will see.</description>

      <description>By Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;This video exposes a very evil proponent of Eastern &#39;Orthodoxy&#39;. The man is a prime example of how Satan raises up false teachers to attack the true Church, lead people astray and into Hell. The video also contains, among other things, some extremely important new arguments to refute Eastern &#39;Orthodoxy&#39;.&#xA;We strongly encourage people to watch this video all the way through. There are important sections throughout and the points build upon each other.</description>

      <description>By Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;In Greek θεότης is a word that refers to the one Godhead, the deity, the divine nature.&amp;nbsp; It is regularly used by the Greek fathers to refer to the one Godhead, i.e. the divine essence common to the three persons.&amp;nbsp; For example, in his Fifth Theological Oration, St. Gregory Nazianzen says: “for the Godhead is One” (μία θεότης).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&#xA;St. Athanasius says: “There is one eternal Godhead in Trinity (άῖδιος καὶ μία Θεότης ἐστίν ἐν Тριάδι).</description>
