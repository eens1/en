<article>
<p>By Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.</p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://vaticancatholic.com/against-protestant-and-schismatics/">vaticancatholic.com</a></p>
<p>The Catholic Church also teaches that those baptized persons who embrace heretical or schismatic sects will lose their souls.  Jesus founded His Church upon St. Peter, as we saw already, and declared that whoever does not hear the Church be considered as the heathen and publican (Matthew 18:17).  He also commanded His followers to observe “all things whatsoever” He has commanded (Matthew 28:20).  The Eastern schismatic sects (such as the “Orthodox”) and the Protestant sects are breakoff movements that have separated from the Catholic Church.  By separating themselves from the one Church of Christ, they leave the path of salvation and enter the path of perdition. </p>
<p>These sects obstinately and pertinaciously reject one or more of the truths that Christ clearly instituted, such as the Papacy (Matthew 16; John 21; etc.), Confession (John 20:23), the Eucharist (John 6:54), and other dogmas of the Catholic Faith.  In order to be saved one must assent to all the things which the Catholic Church, based on Scripture and Tradition, has infallibly defined as dogmas of the Faith.</p>
<p>Below are <em>just a few</em> of the infallible dogmas of the Catholic Faith which are rejected by Protestants and (in the case of the Papacy) by the Eastern “Orthodox.”  The Church “anathematizes” (a severe form of excommunication) all who obstinately assert the contrary to its dogmatic definitions. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"To understand the word anathema…we should first go back to the real meaning of <em>herem</em> of which it is the equivalent.  <em>Herem</em> comes from the word <em>haram,</em> to cut off, to separate, to curse, and indicates that which is cursed and condemned to be cut off or exterminated, whether a person or a thing, and in consequence, that which man is forbidden to make use of.  This is the sense of anathema in the following passage from Deut., vii, 26: ‘Neither shalt thou bring anything of the idol into thy house, lest thou become an anathema like it. Thou shalt detest it as dung, and shalt utterly abhor it as uncleanness and filth, because it is an anathema.’”<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, a Protestant or an “Eastern Orthodox” who obstinately rejects these dogmatic teachings is anathematized and severed from the Church, outside of which there is no salvation.  It’s quite interesting that, in issuing these dogmatic canons, the Church says: “If anyone shall say…. let him be anathema [<em>anathema sit</em>]” as opposed to “If anyone shall say… <em>he is</em> anathema [<em>anathema est].</em>”  This qualification of “let him be” allows room for those Catholics who may be unaware of a particular dogma and would conform to the teaching of the canon as soon as it were presented to him.  The person who is obstinate, however, and willfully contradicts the dogmatic teaching of the Church receives the full force of the automatic condemnation.</p>
<p>The point here is that if one is able to reject these dogmas and still be saved, <em>then these infallible definitions and their accompanying anathemas have no meaning, value or force</em>.  But they do have meaning, value and force – they are infallible teachings protected by Jesus Christ.  Thus, all who reject these dogmas are anathematized and on the road to damnation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Pius XI, <em>Rerum omnium perturbationem</em> (#4), Jan. 26, 1923: “The saint was no less a person that Francis de Sales… <strong>he seemed to have been sent especially by God to contend against <u>the heresies begotten by the [Protestant] Reformation</u>.  It is in these <u>heresies</u> that we discover the beginnings of that apostasy of mankind from the Church</strong>, the sad and disastrous effects of which are deplored, even to the present hour, by every fair mind.”<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a></p>
<p>Pope Julius III, <em>Council of Trent</em>, Session 13, Can. 1 on the Eucharist, <em>ex cathedra</em>:<br />"<strong>If anyone denies that in the sacrament of the most holy Eucharist there are truly, really, and substantially contained the Body and Blood</strong> together with the soul and divinity of our Lord Jesus Christ, and therefore the whole Christ, but shall say that He is in it as by sign or figure, or force, <strong>let him be anathema</strong>."<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>Pope Julius III, <em>Council of Trent</em>, Session 14, Canon 3 on the Sacrament of Penance: “If anyone says that the words of the Lord Savior: ‘Receive ye the Holy Ghost; whose sins you shall forgive, they are forgiven them; and whose sins ye shall retain, they are retained’ [John 20:22 f.], <strong>are not to be understood of the power remitting and retaining sins in the sacrament of penance</strong>… <strong>let him be anathema</strong>.”<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4">[4]</a></p>
<p>Pope Julius III, <em>Council of Trent</em>, Session 14, on Extreme Unction and Penance: “These are the things which this sacred ecumenical synod professes and teaches concerning <strong>the sacraments of penance and extreme unction</strong>, and it sets them forth to be believed and held by all the faithful of Christ.  Moreover, the following canons, it says, must be inviolately observed, and <strong><u>it condemns and anathematizes forever those who assert the contrary</u></strong>.”<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5">[5]</a></p>
<p>Pope Paul III, Council of Trent, Session 6, Chap. 16, <em>ex cathedra</em>:<br />"<strong><u>After this Catholic doctrine of justification</u> - which, <u>unless he faithfully and firmly accepts, no one can be justified</u> </strong>- it seemed good to the holy Synod to add these canons, so that all may know, not only what they must hold and follow, but also what they ought to shun and avoid."<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6">[6]</a></p>
<p>Pope Pius IX, <em>Vatican Council I</em>, 1870, Sess. 4, Chap. 3, ex cathedra: "… <strong><u>all the faithful of Christ must believe that the Apostolic See and the Roman Pontiff hold primacy over the whole world</u>, and the Pontiff of Rome himself is the successor of the blessed Peter, the chief of the apostles, and is the true vicar of Christ and head of the whole Church</strong>... Furthermore We teach and declare that the Roman Church, by the disposition of the Lord, holds the sovereignty of ordinary power over all others… <strong>This is the doctrine of Catholic truth from which no one can deviate and keep his faith and salvation</strong>."<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7">[7]</a></p>
