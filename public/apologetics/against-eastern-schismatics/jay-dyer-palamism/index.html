This video exposes a very evil proponent of Eastern &#39;Orthodoxy&#39;. The man is a prime example of how Satan raises up false teachers to attack the true Church, lead people astray and into Hell. The video also contains, among other things, some extremely important new arguments to refute Eastern &#39;Orthodoxy&#39;.

<p>This video exposes a very evil proponent of Eastern 'Orthodoxy'.   The man is a prime example of how Satan raises up false teachers to attack the true Church, lead people astray and into Hell.  The video also contains, among other things, some extremely important new arguments to refute Eastern 'Orthodoxy'.</p>
<p>We strongly encourage people to watch this video all the way through.  There are important sections throughout and the points build upon each other.  However, a general (not exhaustive) breakdown of what this video contains is as follows:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Dyer has changed his religion at least five times, including apostasy from Christianity around 2010 and a repudiation of Eastern ‘Orthodoxy’ after having embraced it the first time.</li>
 	<li>Dyer lied about the number of his religious changes, saying there were only three when there have been at least five.  He also failed to clearly tell people about the first time he embraced Eastern ‘Orthodoxy’ and then rejected it to return to ‘Catholicism’.</li>
 	<li>When Dyer apostatized from Christ, he embraced various non-Christian religions to some extent, including the Kabbalah, Esotericism, Perennialism, etc.  Dyer also publicly argued against the Incarnation and the Trinity after having spent many years involved with what he deemed to be Christianity.</li>
 	<li>Dyer was a drug user who smoked a lot of weed.  He thought that he got insights about God from his drug use.</li>
 	<li>Dyer is a very wicked instrument of Satan whom the Devil uses to attack the true religion via a cult of personality.</li>
 	<li>In 2019 Dyer featured an image of himself in front of an inverted cross.</li>
 	<li>Dyer is a pagan who CURRENTLY promotes Wicca, Lust, and the Occult.</li>
 	<li>Dyer has never challenged us to a debate, and he publicly stated that he would not debate us.</li>
 	<li>Important introductory info on divine simplicity, the Christian dogma Dyer most frequently attacks.</li>
 	<li>Dyer misrepresents Catholic teaching on divine simplicity.</li>
 	<li>Dyer completely contradicts himself on whether the ‘uncreated energies’ are the divine nature (his core position), demonstrating that he has no idea what he’s talking about and that he makes it up as he goes along.</li>
 	<li>Dyer completely contradicts himself on whether a divine person is the divine essence/nature, after we refuted him on that matter.</li>
 	<li>When cornered, Dyer says that “God transcends such logical categories” to argue that contradictions in his position don’t matter, which means that God’s reality can be contrary to the law of non-contradiction.  That’s agnosticism.</li>
 	<li>Dyer rejects and mocks Actus Purus and thus rejects and mocks God’s immutability – a dogma affirmed by the councils.</li>
 	<li>Refuting Dyer’s stupid argument that if the act of creation is eternal in regard to God as Agent that means that the creation must be eternal.</li>
 	<li>Dyer’s huge and revealing blunder, in which he falsely claims that according to Thomism and Actus Purus the act of walking on water and the destruction of the world are the same thing as the divine essence.  This further demonstrates that he has no idea what he’s talking about.</li>
 	<li>Refuting Dyer’s false claim that the Catholic position would make creation necessary.</li>
 	<li>Refuting Dyer’s false argument that real distinctions between the Three Divine Persons are comparable to, or somehow provide a basis for, the ‘Palamite distinction’.</li>
 	<li>An important quote from the Second Council of Nicea contradicts Palamism.</li>
 	<li>Dyer blatantly misrepresented the content of our first video on Eastern ‘Orthodoxy’, further establishing his dishonesty or ineptitude.</li>
 	<li>Refuting Dyer’s specious arguments concerning Agatho’s letter. Agatho’s letters actually crush Dyer’s position and Palamism.  Dyer calls Agatho’s letter a “damn letter” in a revealing demonic utterance.</li>
 	<li>Dyer teaches that God’s ‘uncreated energies’ are really plural and many, which is heresy against Agatho’s letter.</li>
 	<li>Dyer argues that God’s energy can be both one and many in the same respect.  That’s heresy and literally nonsense.  Nothing can be both one and many in the same respect, but only in different respects.</li>
 	<li>Refuting Dyer’s false argument with regard to the synodical letter of Sophronius of Jerusalem.</li>
 	<li>Dyer publicly endorses a video that calls the Son and the Holy Spirit ‘accidents’, which is modalism (denying that they are true hypostases). The same video heretically asserts that the divine essence has ‘parts’.</li>
 	<li>Dyer lies about our monastery, stating that we live in a trailer when that’s not true.</li>
 	<li>Briefly revisiting Dyer’s false claim that Ex. 3:14 is not about the divine essence, directly contrary to what Eastern fathers say.</li>
 	<li>Dyer admits that he has no objective standard by which to determine that a council is ecumenical or binding – proving our point.</li>
 	<li>Dyer argues that knowing that a council is true comes down to each individual person “knowing God” – which is akin to sola scriptura subjectivism.</li>
 	<li>More on Dyer’s public immorality, wickedness, astounding hypocrisy, etc.</li>
 	<li>About three years ago Dyer publicly endorsed the use of Tarot cards and pagan nature religion.</li>
 	<li>Conclusion</li>
