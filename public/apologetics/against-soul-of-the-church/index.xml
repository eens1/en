      <description>By Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;OBJECTION- It’s possible to belong to the “Soul” of the Church without belonging to her Body. In this way those who die as members of non-Catholic religions can be joined to the Church and saved, as the Baltimore Catechism (1921) explains:&#xA;Q. 512 How are such persons said to belong to the Church?&#xA;A. Such persons are said to belong to the “Soul of the Church”; that is, they are really members of the Church without knowing it.</description>
