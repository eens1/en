<p>To be saved, it is absolutely necessary to profess the traditional Catholic faith and be a member of the Body of Christ, the Catholic Church. This dogmatic teaching admits of no exception. However, many heretics today pervert the meaning that the Church gave once and for all to the dogma Outside the Church there is no salvation, in particular by attaching themselves to erroneous human traditions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Father Pierre of Jean Olivi, Friar Minor: &ldquo;&hellip; it is a diabolical error to attach oneself to the particular opinion of a man with the firmness which is only due to an article of faith.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I encourage you to read the book, <a href="https://vaticancatholic.com/outside-the-church-there-is-no-salvation/">Outside the Catholic Church there is absolutely no salvation</a>, published by Most Holy Family Monastery and which deals in great detail with this fundamental dogma, and responds to all common objections.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>John 15:6 : &ldquo;If anyone abideth not in me, he shall be cast forth as a branch, and shall wither, and they shall gather him up, and cast him into the fire, and he burneth.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no salvation outside of Jesus Christ, and the Catholic Church is His Mystical Body.</p>
