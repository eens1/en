In addition to the ex cathedra (from the Chair of Peter) proclamations of the popes, a Catholic must also believe what is taught by the Catholic Church as divinely revealed in her Ordinary and Universal Magisterium (Magisterium = the teaching authority of the Church).
Pope Pius IX, Vatican I, Sess. III, Chap. 3, ex cathedra: “Further, by divine and Catholic faith, all those things must be believed which are contained in the written word of God and in tradition, and those which are proposed by the Church, either in a solemn pronouncement or in her ordinary and universal teaching power, to be believed as divinely revealed." />

<p>By Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.</p>

<p>In addition to the <em>ex cathedra</em> (from the Chair of Peter) proclamations of the popes, a Catholic must also believe what is taught by the Catholic Church <em><u>as divinely revealed</u></em> in her Ordinary and Universal Magisterium (Magisterium = the teaching authority of the Church).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Pius IX, <em>Vatican I</em>, Sess. III, Chap. 3, <em>ex cathedra</em>: “Further, by divine and Catholic faith, all those things must be believed which are contained in the written word of God and in tradition, and those which are proposed by the Church, either in a solemn pronouncement or in her ordinary and universal teaching power, to be believed <em>as divinely revealed</em>.”<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The teaching of the Ordinary and Universal Magisterium consists of those doctrines which the Church, in her ordinary teaching power spread throughout the whole world, propose to be believed <em><u>as divinely revealed</u></em>.  This is often ascertained from papal encyclicals addressed to the entire Church.  For instance, in their common and universal teaching, approximately 10 popes have denounced the heretical concept of liberty of conscience and worship <u>as contrary to revelation</u>.  A Catholic cannot reject that teaching.  The teaching of the Ordinary and Universal Magisterium can never contradict the teaching of the Chair of Peter (the dogmatic definitions), of course, since both are infallible.  Thus, the Ordinary and Universal Magisterium does not actually have to be considered at all in regard to Outside the Church There is No Salvation, because this dogma has been defined from the Chair of Peter and nothing in the Ordinary and Universal Magisterium can possibly contradict the Chair of Peter.  So <u>beware</u> of those heretics who try to find ways to deny the Church’s dogmatic teaching on Outside the Church There is No Salvation by calling <u>fallible</u>, non-magisterial statements which contradict this dogma, part of the “Ordinary and Universal Magisterium,” when they aren’t.  This is a clever ploy of the heretics. </p>
<p>But the following quotations from many popes are reaffirmations of the dogma Outside the Church There is No Salvation.  These teachings of the popes are part of the Ordinary and Universal Magisterium – and are therefore infallible – since they reiterate the universal teaching of the Chair of St. Peter on the Catholic dogma Outside the Church There is No Salvation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope St. Gregory the Great, quoted in <em>Summo Iugiter Studio, </em>590-604:<br />“The holy universal Church teaches that it is not possible to worship God truly except in her <strong>and asserts that all who are outside of her will not be saved.”</strong><a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a></p>
<p>Pope Clement VI, <em>Super quibusdam</em>, Sept. 20, 1351:<br />“In the second place, we ask whether you and the Armenians obedient to you believe that <strong>no man</strong> <strong>of the wayfarers outside the faith of this Church</strong>, and outside the obedience to the Pope of Rome, <strong>can finally be saved.”</strong><a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4">[4]</a></p>
<p>Pope St. Pius V, <em>Bull excommunicating the heretic Queen Elizabeth of England</em>, Feb. 25, 1570: “The sovereign jurisdiction of <strong>the one holy Catholic and Apostolic Church, outside of which there is no salvation</strong>, has been given by Him [Jesus Christ], unto Whom all power in Heaven and on Earth is given, the King who reigns on high, but to one person on the face of the Earth, to Peter, prince of the Apostles... If any shall contravene this Our decree, we bind them with the same bond of anathema.”<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5">[5]</a></p>
<p>Pope Leo XII, <em>Ubi Primum</em> (# 14), May 5, 1824:<br />“<strong>It is impossible for the most true God</strong>, who is Truth itself, the best, the wisest Provider, and the Rewarder of good men, <strong>to approve all sects who profess false teachings</strong> which are often inconsistent with one another and contradictory, <strong>and to confer eternal rewards on their members</strong>… by divine faith we hold one Lord, one faith, one baptism… <strong>This is why we profess that there is no salvation outside the Church.”</strong><a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6">[6]</a></p>
<p>Pope Leo XII, <em>Quod hoc ineunte</em> (# 8), May 24, 1824: “<strong>We address all of you who are still removed from the true Church and the road to salvation</strong>.  In this universal rejoicing, one thing is lacking: that having been called by the inspiration of the Heavenly Spirit and having broken every decisive snare, you might sincerely agree with <strong>the mother Church, outside of whose teachings there is no salvation.”</strong><a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7">[7]</a></p>
<p>Pope Gregory XVI, <em>Mirari Vos</em> (# 13), Aug. 15, 1832:  <br />“With the admonition of the apostle, that ‘there is one God, one faith, one baptism’ (Eph. 4:5), may those fear who contrive the notion that the safe harbor of salvation is open to persons of any religion whatever.  They should consider the testimony of Christ Himself that ‘those who are not with Christ are against Him,’ (Lk. 11:23) and that they disperse unhappily <u>who do not gather with Him.</u> <strong> Therefore, ‘without a doubt, they will perish forever, unless they hold the Catholic faith whole and inviolate</strong> <strong>(Athanasian Creed)</strong>.”<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8">[8]</a></p>
<p>Pope Gregory XVI, <em>Summo Iugiter Studio</em> (# 2), May 27, 1832:<br /><strong>“Finally some of these misguided people attempt to persuade themselves and others that men are not saved only in the Catholic religion, but that even heretics may attain eternal life.”</strong><a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9">[9]</a></p>
<p>Pope Pius IX, <em>Ubi primum </em>(# 10), June 17, 1847: “<strong>For ‘there is one universal Church outside of which no one at all is saved</strong>; it contains regular and secular prelates along with those under their jurisdiction, <strong>who all profess one Lord, one faith and one baptism.”</strong><a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10">[10]</a></p>
<p>Pope Pius IX, <em>Nostis et Nobiscum </em>(# 10), Dec. 8, 1849: “In particular, <strong>ensure that the faithful are deeply and thoroughly convinced of the truth of the doctrine that the Catholic faith is necessary for attaining salvation</strong>. (This doctrine, received from Christ and emphasized by the Fathers and Councils, is also contained in the formulae of the profession of faith used by Latin, Greek and Oriental Catholics).”<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11">[11]</a></p>
<p>Pope Pius IX, <em>Syllabus of Modern Errors</em>, Dec. 8, 1864 - Proposition 16: “Man may, in the observance of any religion whatever, <u>find the way of eternal salvation</u>, and <u>arrive</u> at eternal salvation.”<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12"><strong>[12]</strong></a> – <strong>Condemned</strong></p>
<p>Pope Leo XIII, <em>Tametsi futura prospicientibus </em>(# 7), Nov. 1, 1900:<em>  </em>“Christ is man’s ‘Way’; the Church also is his ‘Way’… <strong>Hence all who would find salvation apart from the Church, are led astray and strive in vain.”</strong><a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13">[13]</a></p>
<p>Pope St. Pius X, <em>Iucunda sane</em> (# 9), March 12, 1904: “Yet at the same time We cannot but remind all, great and small, as Pope St. Gregory did, of <strong>the absolute necessity of having recourse to this Church in order to have eternal salvation</strong>…”<a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14">[14]</a></p>
<p>Pope St. Pius X, <em>Editae saepe</em> (# 29), May 26, 1910: <strong>“The Church alone</strong> possesses together with her magisterium the power of governing and sanctifying human society.  Through her ministers and servants (each in his own station and office), she <strong>confers on mankind suitable and necessary means of salvation.”</strong><a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15">[15]</a></p>
<p>Pope Pius XI, <em>Mortalium Animos</em> (# 11), Jan. 6, 1928:  “<strong>The Catholic Church</strong> is alone in keeping the true worship.  This is the fount of truth, this is the house of faith, this is the temple of God: <strong>if any man enter not here, or if any man go forth from it, he is a stranger to the hope of life and salvation</strong>.”<a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16">[16]</a></p>
