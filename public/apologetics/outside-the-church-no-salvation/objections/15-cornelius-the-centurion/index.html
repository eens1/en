OBJECTION- Acts 10:47 says that Cornelius and his companions received the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; This means that they were justified without Baptism.
ANSWER- Acts 10:47 does not say that Cornelius and his companions were justified without Baptism.&nbsp; Nothing there says that their sins were remitted or that they were “saved,” a phrase frequently used to describe those who have been justified by Baptism.&nbsp; The context of Acts 10 is dealing with receiving the Holy Ghost by receiving the gift of speaking in tongues, not having one’s sins remitted." />

<p><strong><u>OBJECTION-</u></strong> Acts 10:47 says that Cornelius and his companions received the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; This means that they were justified without Baptism.</p>
<p><strong><u>ANSWER</u></strong><strong>- </strong>Acts 10:47 does not say that Cornelius and his companions were justified without Baptism.&nbsp; Nothing there says that their sins were remitted or that they were “saved,” a phrase frequently used to describe those who have been justified by Baptism.&nbsp; The context of Acts 10 is dealing with <em>receiving the Holy Ghost by receiving the gift of speaking in tongues</em>, not having one’s sins remitted.&nbsp; Acts 10:47, therefore, is merely speaking of Cornelius and his companions having received the gift of tongues.&nbsp; The description “receiving the Holy Ghost” or “being filled with the Holy Ghost” is actually used frequently in scripture to describe a person making a godly prophecy or receiving some spiritual gift.&nbsp; It does not necessarily mean that one has received the remission of sins.&nbsp; The following two passages are examples of the phrase “filled with the Holy Ghost” being used to describe a spiritual gift (prophesy, etc.), not the remission of sins.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Luke 1:41-42 “And it came to pass, that when Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the infant leaped in her womb: <strong>and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost</strong>: <strong><u>And she cried out</u></strong> with a loud voice…”</p>
<p class="MsoHeader">Luke 1:67 “And Zachary, his father, <strong>was filled with the Holy Ghost, <u>and he prophesied</u></strong>, saying…”</p>
