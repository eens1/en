<h1>The Sacrament of Baptism is Necessary for Salvation</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>By Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.</p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://vaticancatholic.com/sacrament-of-baptism-necessary-for-salvation">vaticancatholic.com</a></p>
<p>To further show that the Sacrament of Baptism is necessary for salvation, I will quote numerous other infallible statements from the Chair of St. Peter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Paul III, <em>The Council of Trent</em>, Sess. 7, Can. 5 on the <u>Sacrament</u> of Baptism, <strong><em>ex cathedra</em></strong>: <strong>“If anyone says that baptism [the Sacrament] is optional, that is, not necessary for salvation (cf. Jn. 3:5): let him be anathema.”</strong><a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong> </strong>This infallible dogmatic definition from the Chair of St. Peter condemns anyone who says that the Sacrament of Baptism is not necessary for salvation.  The Sacrament of Baptism is necessary for all for salvation, first of all, because, as the Council of Trent defines, all men (except the Blessed Virgin Mary) were conceived in a state of original sin <u>as a result of the sin of Adam, the first man</u>.  The Sacrament of Baptism is also necessary for all for salvation because it is the means by which one is marked as a member of Jesus Christ and incorporated into His Mystical Body.  And in defining the truth that all men were conceived in the state of Original Sin, the Council of Trent specifically declared that the Blessed Virgin Mary was an exception to its decree on Original Sin.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a>  But in defining the truth that the Sacrament of Baptism is necessary for salvation, the Council of Trent made no exceptions at all.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Eugene IV, <em>The Council of Florence</em>, “Exultate Deo,” Nov. 22, 1439:<strong>  </strong>“Holy baptism, which is the gateway to the spiritual life, holds the first place among all the sacraments; through it we are made members of Christ and of the body of the Church.  <strong>And since death entered the universe through the first man, ‘<u>unless we are born again of water and the Spirit, we cannot,’ as the Truth says, ‘enter into the kingdom of heaven’</u> [John 3:5].</strong>  The matter of this sacrament is real and natural water.”<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>Pope Innocent III, <em>Fourth Lateran Council</em>, Constitution 1, 1215, <em>ex cathedra</em>: <strong>“But the sacrament of baptism is consecrated in water at the invocation of the undivided Trinity – namely, Father, Son and Holy Ghost – and brings salvation to both children and adults</strong> when it is correctly carried out by anyone in the form laid down by the Church.”<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4">[4]</a></p>
<p>Pope Benedict XIV, <em>Nuper ad nos</em>, March 16, 1743, Profession of Faith: <strong>“Likewise (I profess) that baptism is necessary for salvation, and hence, if there is imminent danger of death, it should be conferred at once and without delay, </strong>and that it is valid if conferred with the right matter and form and intention by anyone, and at any time.”<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5">[5]</a></p>
<p>Pope Pius XI, <em>Quas Primas </em>(# 15), Dec. 11, 1925 :  “Indeed this kingdom is presented in the Gospels as such, into which men prepare to enter by doing penance; <strong><u>moreover, they cannot enter it except through</u></strong> <strong>faith and baptism</strong>, which, although <strong><u>an external rite</u></strong>, yet signifies and effects an interior regeneration.”<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6">[6]</a> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>We see here that one cannot enter the kingdom of Heaven without faith and the external rite of baptism (i.e., the Sacrament of Baptism).</p>
