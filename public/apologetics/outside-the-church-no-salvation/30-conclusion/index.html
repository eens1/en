<article>
<p>By Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.</p>

<p>In this document I have shown that it is the infallible teaching of the Catholic Church – and therefore the true teaching of Jesus Christ – that only those who die as baptized Catholics can be saved.  Anyone who refuses to accept this teaching is not a Catholic.  The fact that most of the world refuses to accept this teaching must not get us discouraged.  This has been predicted and God is still with His Church, even though it has been reduced to a remnant of faithful Catholics.      </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fr. William Jurgens: “At one point in the Church’s history, only a few years before Gregory’s [Nazianz] present preaching (+380 A.D.), <u>perhaps the number of Catholic bishops in possession of sees, as opposed to Arian bishops in possession of sees, was no greater than something between 1% and 3% of the total</u>.  <strong>Had doctrine been determined by popularity, today we should all be deniers of Christ and opponents of the Spirit</strong>.”<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Fr. William Jurgens: “In the time of the Emperor Valens (4<sup>th</sup> century), Basil was virtually the only orthodox Bishop in all the East who succeeded in retaining charge of his see… If it has no other importance for modern man, <strong><u>a knowledge of the history of Arianism should demonstrate at least that the Catholic Church takes no account of popularity and numbers in shaping and maintaining doctrine</u>: </strong>else, we should long since have had to abandon Basil and Hilary and Athanasius and Liberius and Ossius and call ourselves after Arius.”<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the Arian heresy in the 4<sup>th</sup> century was so bad that approximately 1% of the jurisdictional bishops remained Catholic and 99% became Arian, and the Great Apostasy preceding the Second Coming of Christ is predicted <u>to be even worse</u> – the worst apostasy of all time (2 Thess. 2) – then one should not be incredulous at the fact that there are barely any authentically Catholic priests in the world today who believe in the true meaning of Outside the Church There is No Salvation and the necessity of the Sacrament of Baptism.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Luke 18:8 “But yet the Son of man, when he cometh, shall he find, think you, faith on earth?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We must surge forward in defense of this faith and preserve it undefiled.  We must inform in charity those non-Catholics whom God puts on our path that they must embrace the Catholic Faith – the traditional, historical Catholic Faith – if they want to be saved.  And we must inform those professing to be Catholic, but who don’t believe in these dogmas, how they are in error so that they can be corrected. </p>
<p>We believe in this dogma only because it is the truth of Jesus Christ.  And because we love non-Catholics and have true concern for their eternal happiness as their true friends, we tell them that they cannot obtain eternal happiness except in the Catholic Church (the traditional Catholic Church, not the Novus Ordo/Vatican II sect). </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Luke 12:4-5: “[Jesus saith] And I say to you, <u>my friends</u>: <strong>Be not afraid of them who kill the body</strong>, and after that have no more that they can do.  But I will shew you whom you shall fear: fear ye him, who after he hath killed, hath power to cast into hell.  Yea, I say to you, fear him.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, one cannot compromise this faith at any cost.  One cannot financially support any priest who does not hold that <u>only baptized Catholics</u> can be saved, which includes almost every priest today.  <strong>One cannot financially support or give Mass stipends to any priest who accepts baptism of desire or the heresy of salvation for the “invincibly ignorant.”  </strong>One cannot join or be affiliated with any religious society which does not preserve and publicly defend this dogma and <em>all</em> the teachings of the Church. </p>
<p>A Catholic should not attend funerals of deceased non-Catholics, since this implies that non-Catholics can be saved, which is heresy.  A Catholic also should not attend the funerals of “Catholics” who were known to deny this dogma or who were known to obstinately support those who denied it.  Further, a Catholic should not attend the Weddings of non-Catholics or members of the Novus Ordo, since this gives scandal and it gives the non-Catholics getting married the impression that you approve of them where they are.  Nor should a Catholic attend the wedding of a person who claims to be a “traditional Catholic” yet obstinately supports the heretical positions or heretical groups exposed in this document.  To do so would be a scandal and a compromise of the Faith. </p>
<p>On Judgment Day, God will separate those who have preserved the true Faith and the state of grace from those who have not.  Those who have defiled this faith will have to line up with the reprobate.  So those who, knowing these facts, continue to financially support, even in the slightest way, groups which believe in baptism of desire or salvation for the “invincibly ignorant” or which deny any other teaching of the Church, can expect to line up behind the reprobate who have defiled the Faith on Judgment Day.</p>
<p>The Church teaches that in a necessity such as the one we are dealing with now, one may receive the sacraments from a validly ordained priest who holds a heretical position (if the priest does not notoriously preach or impose that heresy), but one may not support him financially or compromise the Faith.  To <em>put money in the collection basket</em> of a priest or a group who does not uphold the Faith is to deny the Faith.  To give them donations is to deny the Faith.  Obviously, the Catholic Faith does not forbid us to buy Catholic books (etc.) from a group which may be heretical, but one must not donate to such a group or even give them Mass stipends.  If it comes down to compromising the faith or attending Mass and receiving Communion, one must stop attending Mass and receiving Communion, because one can be saved without attending Mass and receiving Communion, especially in a state of necessity; but one cannot ever be saved without the true faith.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apoc. 2:10 “Be thou faithful until death: and I will give thee the crown of life.”</p>
<p><span style="font-size: inherit;">Apoc. 14:12 “Here is the patience of the saints, who keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.”</span></p>

<p>36. Conclusion</p>
<p>In this document I have shown that it is the infallible teaching of the Catholic Church – and therefore the true teaching of Jesus Christ – that only those who die as baptized Catholics can be saved.  Anyone who refuses to accept this teaching is not a Catholic.  The fact that most of the world refuses to accept this teaching must not get us discouraged.  This has been predicted and God is still with His Church, even though it has been reduced to a remnant of faithful Catholics.      </p>
