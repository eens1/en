<h1>Bishop Fellay says Hindus can be saved</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>By Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bishop Bernard Fellay, Superior General of SSPX, <em>Conference in Denver</em>, Co., Feb. 18, 2006: “<strong>We know that there are two other baptisms</strong>, that of desire and that of blood.  These produce an invisible but real link with Christ but do not produce all of the effects which are received in the baptism of water… <strong>And the Church has always taught that you have people who will be in heaven, who are in the state of grace, who have been saved without knowing the Catholic Church.  We know this.  And yet, how is it possible if you cannot be saved outside the Church?  It is absolutely true that they will be saved through </strong>the Catholic Church because they will be united to Christ, to the Mystical Body of Christ, which is the Catholic Church.  It will, however, remain invisible, because this visible link is impossible for them.  <strong><u>Consider a Hindu in Tibet who has no knowledge of the Catholic Church.  He lives according to his conscience and to the laws which God has put into his heart.  He can be in the state of grace</u></strong>, and if he dies in this state of grace, <strong>he will go to heaven</strong>.”<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is more blatant heresy.  Hindus, by the way, worship many false gods; they are not only without the Catholic Faith necessary for salvation, but idolaters.</p>
