      <description>Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;The following statements on Outside the Catholic Church There is No Salvation are from the highest teaching authority of the Catholic Church.&amp;nbsp; They are ex cathedra Papal decrees (decrees from the Chair of St. Peter).&amp;nbsp; Therefore, they constitute the teaching given to the Catholic Church by Jesus Christ and the Apostles.&amp;nbsp; Such teachings are unchangeable and are classified as part of the solemn magisterium (the extraordinary teaching authority of the Catholic Church).</description>

      <description>By Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;In discussing this crucial dogma of the faith, I felt that it was important to address something to those of you who believe in baptism of desire, in order to sum up certain points. First, when the facts are laid on the table, you must admit that baptism of desire has never been infallibly taught. The only two quotations from the infallible Magisterium that you even try to bring forward (Sess.</description>

      <description>By Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;ALL TRUE JUSTICE MEETS UP WITH THE SACRAMENTS (de fide) In the Foreword to Sess. 7 of the Council of Trent’s Decree on the Sacraments there is a very important statement.&#xA;Pope Paul III, Council of Trent, Sess. 7, Foreword, ex cathedra: “For the completion of the salutary doctrine of Justification… it has seemed fitting to treat of the most holy sacraments of the Church, through which all true justice either begins, or being begun is increased or being lost is restored.</description>

      <title>Catholics Must Believe and Profess that the Sacramental System as a whole is Necessary for Salvation (de fide)</title>

      <description>By Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;Another very important aspect to this issue is the Dogmatic Profession of Faith issued by the Council of Trent and by Vatican Council I. Both councils infallibly declared that the sacramental system as a whole is necessary for salvation, and this truth must be professed and believed by all Catholics and by converts.&#xA;Pope Pius IV, “Iniunctum nobis,” Nov. 13, 1565, ex cathedra: “I also profess that there are truly and properly seven sacraments of the New Law instituted by Jesus Christ our Lord, and necessary for the salvation of mankind, although all are not necessary for each individual…”[1]</description>

      <description>By Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;In this document I have shown that it is the infallible teaching of the Catholic Church – and therefore the true teaching of Jesus Christ – that only those who die as baptized Catholics can be saved. Anyone who refuses to accept this teaching is not a Catholic. The fact that most of the world refuses to accept this teaching must not get us discouraged.</description>

      <description>By Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;The heresy that “invincible ignorance” saves those who die as non-Catholics and that non-Catholics can be saved by “baptism of desire” often quickly results in an apostasy from Christ Himself. The famous Irish priest, Fr. Denis Fahey, is a case in point.&#xA;Fr. Denis Fahey, The Kingship of Christ and the Conversion of the Jewish Nation (1953), p. 52: “The Jews, as a nation, are objectively aiming at giving society a direction which is in complete opposition to the order God wants.</description>

      <description>By Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;Recently, an article was published by Fr. Anthony Cekada called Baptism of Desire and Theological Principles. Fr. Cekada is a “traditionalist” priest who rightly rejects Vatican II but yet holds the heresy common to almost all today: that those who die as non-Catholics can be saved. Fr. Cekada is, therefore, a person who rejects the Catholic dogma that the Catholic Faith is necessary for salvation.</description>

      <description>By Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;OBJECTION- Our Lady herself revealed at Bayside and Medjugorje that non-Catholics can be saved, so you are wrong.&#xA;“Our Lady” of Bayside, August 14, 1979: “Do not judge your brothers and sisters who have not been converted.&amp;nbsp; For My Father’s House, My Son has repeated over and over, remember always – that in My Father’s House, there are many rooms in the Mansion, signifying faiths and creeds.</description>

      <title>Believe Dogma as it was once declared</title>

      <description>By Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;There is only one way to believe dogma: as holy mother Church has once declared.&#xA;This definition of the First Vatican Council is critically important for dogmatic purity, because the primary way the Devil attempts to corrupt Christ’s doctrines is by getting men to recede (move away) from the Church’s dogmas as they were once declared. &amp;nbsp;There is no meaning of a dogma other than what the words themselves state and declare, so the Devil tries to get men to “understand” and “interpret” these words in a way that is different from how holy mother Church has declared them.</description>

      <description>By Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;I have discussed the teaching of the Council of Florence on Baptism in earlier sections; but, due to the fact that the teaching of Exultate Deo from the Council of Florence excludes the possibility of baptism of desire and baptism of blood, I want to show clearly that it is infallible and cannot be contradicted. Pope Eugene IV, The Council of Florence, “Exultate Deo,” Nov.</description>

      <title>Infants Cannot Be Saved Without Baptism</title>

      <description>By Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;The teaching of the Catholic Church already cited shows that no one can be saved without the Sacrament of Baptism. Obviously, therefore, this means that children and infants also cannot get to Heaven without Baptism because they are conceived in a state of original sin, which cannot be removed without the Sacrament of Baptism. But this truth of the Catholic Church is denied by many people today.</description>

      <description>By Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;In addition to the ex cathedra (from the Chair of Peter) proclamations of the popes, a Catholic must also believe what is taught by the Catholic Church as divinely revealed in her Ordinary and Universal Magisterium (Magisterium = the teaching authority of the Church).&#xA;Pope Pius IX, Vatican I, Sess. III, Chap. 3, ex cathedra: “Further, by divine and Catholic faith, all those things must be believed which are contained in the written word of God and in tradition, and those which are proposed by the Church, either in a solemn pronouncement or in her ordinary and universal teaching power, to be believed as divinely revealed.</description>

      <description>By Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;This video will focus on the dogma that one must be subject to the Roman Pontiff to be saved and how this dogma also proves that no one can be saved without the Sacrament of Baptism.&amp;nbsp; In the famous bull Unam Sanctam of 1302, Pope Boniface VIII declared that there is no salvation nor remission of sins outside the Catholic Church.&amp;nbsp; He then solemnly defined:</description>

      <description>By Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;OBJECTION- You are acting like a Protestant. The Protestant privately interprets Sacred Scripture, while you privately interpret dogmatic statements.&#xA;ANSWER- This objection was refuted in Section 2 of this document, “Believe Dogma As It Was Once Declared.”&#xA;Pope Pius IX, First Vatican Council, Sess. 3, Chap. 2 on Revelation, 1870, ex cathedra: “Hence, also, that understanding of its sacred dogmas must be perpetually retained, which Holy Mother Church has once declared; and there must never be a recession from that meaning under the specious name of a deeper understanding.</description>

      <description>By Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;OBJECTION- You can’t judge if all non-Catholics go to Hell. You are not God. You must leave such judgments to Him.&#xA;ANSWER- God has already revealed His judgment to us. To say that one cannot be sure or “cannot judge” if all who die as non-Catholics go to hell is simply to reject God’s judgment as possibly untrue, which is heresy and blasphemy and pride of the worst kind.</description>

      <description>By Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;The Athanasian Creed is one of the most important creeds of the Catholic Faith. It contains a beautiful summary of a Catholic’s belief in the Trinity and the Incarnation, which are the two fundamental dogmas of Christianity. Before the 1971 changes in the Liturgy, the Athanasian Creed, consisting of 40 rhythmic statements, had been used in the Sunday Office for over a thousand years.</description>

      <description>By Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;OBJECTION- Our Lady said that whoever dies wearing the Brown Scapular will not go to Hell. This means that you are wrong: non-Catholics and the unbaptized can be saved who die wearing the Scapular.&#xA;ANSWER- Everyone should wear the Brown Scapular; it is a sign of devotion to Our Lady and a powerful sacramental. And we too originally believed that whoever dies wearing the Brown Scapular could not go to Hell.</description>

      <description>By Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;It is a fact of history, scripture and tradition that Our Lord Jesus Christ founded His universal Church (the Catholic Church) upon St. Peter.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&#xA;Matthew 16:18-19-“And I say to thee: That thou art Peter: and upon this rock I will build my Church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.

      <description>By Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;OBJECTION- Objectively speaking, there is absolutely no salvation outside the Catholic Church. But subjectively speaking, we just don’t know.&#xA;ANSWER- This is similar to the “You Can’t Judge” heresy. Those who advance this heresy deny dogmatic truth; for the Objective-Subjective Heresy means that the dogma Outside the Church There is No Salvation is only true “objectively,” which necessarily means that non-Catholics can be saved “subjectively,” which means that the end result is a denial of the defined dogma.</description>

      <description>By Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;Pope Innocent III, Fourth Lateran Council, Constitution 1, 1215, ex cathedra: “THERE IS INDEED ONE UNIVERSAL CHURCH OF THE FAITHFUL, outside of which nobody at all is saved, in which Jesus Christ is both priest and sacrifice.”[1]&#xA;The first dogmatic definition from the Chair of Peter on Outside the Church There is No Salvation (from Pope Innocent III) taught that the Catholic Church is the one Church “of the faithful,” outside of which no one at all is saved.</description>

      <description>By Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;As I have proven above, there is no possible way for children to be freed from original sin other than through the Sacrament of Baptism.&amp;nbsp; This, of course, proves that there is no way for infants to be saved other than through the Sacrament of Baptism.&amp;nbsp; So the following definitions merely affirm what has already been established: no child can possibly enter the kingdom of Heaven without receiving water baptism, but will rather descend into Hell.</description>
