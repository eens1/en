      <description>By Brother Peter Dimond, O.S.B.&#xA;Source: vaticancatholic.com&#xA;Bro. Peter Dimond&#xA;A false traditionalist priest recently accused us of blatant modernism because we point out a difference in the wording and in the ultimate application of Jesus’ profound statements in John 6, concerning the necessity to receive the Eucharist for salvation, and John 3:5 concerning the necessity to receive the Sacrament of Baptism for salvation. We will quote what he said and then refute it.</description>
