<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: center;"><em>Mother Angelica, the foundress of the Eternal Word Television Network (EWTN)</em>[3]</p>
<p>One of the “conservative” organizations affiliated with the <a title="Vatican II “Catholic” Church Exposed" href="https://vaticancatholic.com/vatican-ii-exposed/">Vatican II sect</a> is EWTN, the global “Catholic” television network. Some misguided people have persuaded themselves and others that EWTN is a strong defender of Catholic truth spreading light to millions in a dark world. However, despite what many think, EWTN is actually a vehicle for some of the worst of the post-Vatican II apostasy. EWTN promoted John Paul II’s interreligious apostasy at Assisi, and covered with approval Benedict XVI’s apostasy at the synagogue in Germany, as well as his initiation into Islam in a mosque in Turkey. EWTN promotes the heresy of salvation outside the Church; its show, <em>The Journey Home,</em> treats conversion to the Catholic Faith from Protestant sects as a preference, but not a necessity. This heretical and evil idea, that adhering to Protestant sects which reject the teaching of the true Church doesn’t bar one from salvation, is articulated by almost all of the “converts” from Protestantism featured on <em>The Journey Home</em>.</p>
<p>EWTN’s foundress Mother Angelica, who has been one of the most significant figures in the post-Vatican II sect, especially for its more “conservative” members, is someone for us to consider. Speaking about other religions during one show, EWTN foundress Mother Angelica asserted with pure religious indifferentism that we all have the same God. She specifically said: “You call him Allah, and we call him Jesus.” For the Jubilee Year in 2000, Mother Angelica was repeatedly featured citing a Jubilee prayer. In the prayer, Mother Angelica mentioned the “great religions” of the world – a quotation of John Paul II’s and Paul VI’s frequent expression of religious indifferentism.</p>
<p>On another show with Mother Angelica, Alice Von Hildebrand (a frequent guest on EWTN) bluntly asserted that one can get to Heaven as a Buddhist. The way it was stated not only indicated that Buddhists can be saved (which is heresy, of course), but that there is no obligation <em>whatsoever</em> for a Buddhist to be a Catholic. In the face of this tremendous heresy and religious indifferentism, which was asserted right in front of her face, Mother Angelica posed no objection, and even commented with approval. Mother Angelica and EWTN have always been defenders of the heretical teachings of Vatican II.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Mother Angelica was also an outspoken defender of the worst kind of false ecumenism, including with Jews</strong></span>. In one show, Mother Angelica and Fr. Benedict Groeschel were discussing the recent death of “Cardinal” John O’Connor. Fr. Groeschel mentioned that the Jews held a Jewish service <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in St. Patrick’s Cathedral</span> after the death of “Cardinal” John O’Connor. Groeschel, an incredible apostate, thought that the Jewish service in the Cathedral was a great thing. <strong>Mother Angelica also wasted no time in blurting out: “That’s awesome!”</strong></p>
<p>Thus, Mother Angelica held that the worst kind of false ecumenism – a Jewish service in St. Patrick’s Cathedral itself – is “awesome.” These facts, by the way, refute the ridiculous assertion which was made in a book which is cited below: that EWTN supposedly went Modernist only after the departure of Mother Angelica from the reins of power. There is an article on our website giving more detail about this issue. But even Raymond Arroyo, who wrote the biography for Mother Angelica and is one of her biggest supporters, bluntly admitted that <em>she was a promoter of ecumenism whose work could therefore be supported by members of non-Catholic religions</em>. “The monastery [under Mother Angelica] had become <strong>an ecumenical touchstone</strong> in Birmingham, an inspired project <strong>that Protestants, Jews,</strong> and Catholics could <strong>support</strong>. The personality of Mother Angelica made it so.”[3]</p>
<p>In short, EWTN is a mechanism by which the Devil made post-Vatican II conservative-minded professing Catholics comfortable with the post-Vatican II apostasy.</p>
<p>In 1980, Mother Angelica went to North Carolina and appeared on the Protestant television network called PTL, which was founded by Assembly of God minister Jim Bakker and his wife, Tammy Faye. “Mother Angelica had appeared on PTL several times throughout 1979, to great acclaim, and was ranked in the polls as an audience favorite… <strong>Bakker was so taken with the nun, he dispatched a team of scenic designers to Birmingham to build her first studio set</strong>.”[4] The fact that a Protestant minister was so impressed with her that he actually sent a team to design her studio demonstrates, once again, that her message was not Catholic, but ecumenical.</p>
<p>Mother Angelica was also actively involved in <strong>the Charismatic movement</strong>, a movement which is quite widespread in the Vatican II sect. The Charismatic movement is a false movement heavily infected with heretical and Protestant tendencies and ideas. On February 11, 1971, “Barbara Schlemon, a charismatic reputed to have the gift of healing, passed through Birmingham and asked Fr. De Grandis [a Charismatic priest] to take her to meet Mother Angelica… In the chapel, <strong>Schlemon and the priest laid hands on Mother</strong>, invoking the baptism of the Holy Spirit.”[5] <strong>About a week later “a foreign tongue spilled from Mother Angelica’s mouth inexplicably</strong>. When Sister Regina came to deliver a glass of orange juice, Mother tried to say thank you, <strong>but ‘something else came out</strong>.’”[6] We must emphasize that this very significant fact is admitted in a biography about Mother Angelica which was written by one of her biggest supporters: the anchor of her network, Raymond Arroyo.</p>
<p>“<strong>On Holy Saturday in 1971, Father De Grandis and Mother prayed over each member of the community</strong>. All but one nun experienced the baptism of the Holy Spirit, and everyone received something. Following this experience, Sister Joseph and other nuns believed the Lord began speaking to them. <strong>By Easter Sunday, the whole community was ‘speaking in tongues</strong>.’”[7]</p>
<p>Speaking in languages not known by the individual who is speaking them, speaking in gibberish, etc. is very often a sign of diabolical possession. This is especially true when it comes as a result of a Charismatic experience in which one has had hands laid on him or her in order to receive “the spirit.” Readers are, of course, perfectly free to take this or leave it: but an individual we know from Massachusetts, who was heavily involved in the Charismatic movement years ago, actually told one of us that he felt a demon enter him after a Charismatic had laid his hand on him at a service. He also told us that, at one Charismatic conference, God allowed him to see a small demon enter a room. Amazed, he followed the demon and waited to see if it would come back out of the room; but the only thing which emerged from the room was the Charismatic priest who was about to perform his “healing” service by praying over people. This experience caused this individual to abandon the Charismatic movement.</p>
<p>We believe that God allows the Devil to take people over in these Charismatic services because <em>by partaking in them people are essentially saying that the sacraments of the Catholic Church, the seven instituted by Jesus Christ, are not sufficient</em>. They are professing, therefore, that they need a new set of man-made rites – rites which are outside the sacramental system – <strong>in order to really receive “the spirit.”</strong> By participation in such “rites,” they are essentially participating in a new religion in order to gain access to “the spirit” outside the means specifically set up by Christ. As a consequence, these Charismatic “rites” become new “sacraments” of a false religion which give access to the evil, not the Holy, spirit.</p>
<p>It should be emphasized that the laying on of hands is present throughout the New Testament as the matter for the Sacrament of Confirmation (e.g. Acts 8:17; Acts 19:6) – a sacrament instituted by Jesus Christ. It’s ironic that in the new “Confirmation” in the Vatican II sect the laying on of hands has been abolished, but Charismatics continue to use the laying on of hands in their own services in order to transmit “the spirit.” <strong>Since we know that <em>their laying on of hands in an attempt to transmit the “spirit” is not the Sacrament of Confirmation</em> (for even women and laymen do it), it is actually the Counter Confirmation – a false sacrament which therefore gives access, once again, not to the Holy, but to the evil spirit. </strong></p>
<p>So, as a worthy recipient of the Sacrament of Confirmation receives a deeper endowment of the Holy Ghost, the active participation in such new “rites” or “sacraments” of the false Charismatic religion – by partaking in things such as the laying on of hands – gives these unfortunate individuals a deep endowment of the evil spirit. <strong>That’s why at many of these Charismatic meetings the “Catholics” actually find themselves oinking like pigs, barking like dogs, and breaking out into outrageously uncontrollable laughter.</strong> These things, especially oinking like pigs and barking like dogs, are clear signs of demonic possession.</p>
<p>We make reference to this individual’s experience because Mother Angelica herself not only spoke repeatedly of her own mystical “experiences,” but she also admitted something striking about her reaction to having hands laid on her by Charismatics. Her reaction dovetails with this gentleman’s experience. Mother Angelica said that her experience, <strong><em>in which words she hadn’t intended to speak spilled out of her mouth after having had hands laid on her by Charismatics</em></strong>, scared her. She recalled: “<strong>Words came out, but I didn’t know what they were. It scared me.</strong>”[8] Mother Angelica didn’t realize that it was an evil spirit which she had picked up after involvement with the Charismatics. She continued to promote this movement.</p>
<p>On Dec. 2, 1977, Mother Angelica led a Charismatic retreat in Birmingham with 28 leaders in her work, who were called “Guardians.” Standing in the chapel, “<strong>Mother laid her hands on each guardian, praying in tongues for their fidelity. Some sang out in </strong>holy<strong> gibberish</strong>, others were ‘slain in the Spirit.’”[9] One of the participants said afterwards that it was “<strong>charismania at its height</strong>.”[10] After the death of Paul VI, “<strong>Mother Angelica laid hands on Matt Scalici, Jr.</strong> in her chapel.”[11]</p>
<p>Mother Angelica’s biography claims that after this time she “gradually” pulled out of the Charismatic movement. This is an empty claim, for her network continued to promote the biggest charismatics in the country, such as the figures at Franciscan University and those of their ilk.</p>
<p>We find Mother Angelica’s early involvement in the diabolical Charismatic movement very significant. It’s significant because EWTN has been a vehicle by which the Devil has kept many “conservatives” inside the Vatican II sect by its mixture of conservatism (i.e. some things which are true to Catholic Tradition) with the apostasy of the Vatican II religion. Personalities such as Mother Angelica have acted as magnets to keep “conservatives” deceived and devoted to the Counter Church. Many are persuaded that figures such as Mother Angelica in the post-Vatican II “Church” are proof that true spiritual vitality is still to be found there when, in truth, it is a false “Church” and adherence to its apostasy leads to damnation. It makes sense that the leader of this deceptive apostolate at EWTN, Mother Angelica, got her start by receiving a diabolical spirit at a Charismatic event.</p>
<p>In fact, Mother Angelica has claimed that numerous mystical experiences guided her course at EWTN.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 50px;">“During a bright spot in her convalescence, <strong>Mother claims to have seen the child Jesus dashing down the halls of the monastery</strong>. This was by no means an isolated event.”[12]</p>
<p>Does it sound like the Child Jesus to be “dashing down the halls”? Or does it sound more like what a demon would be doing as he goes about his work for the destruction of souls? Based on what we’ve covered already about Mother Angelica’s endorsement of heresy, false religions and the diabolical Charismatic movement, a true Catholic would have to conclude that Mother Angelica actually saw the latter, not the former.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Matthew 24:24-25- “For there shall arise false Christs and <strong>false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders,</strong> <strong>insomuch as to deceive (if possible) even the elect</strong>. Behold I have told it to you, beforehand.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mother Angelica also claimed that the Child Jesus appeared to her and told her, “<strong>Build me a temple</strong> and I will help those who help you.”[13] While churches can be described as “temples” – as we covered earlier in the section on 2 Thess. 2:4 – a “temple” can also describe a Jewish house of worship and a Masonic lodge. Since Mother Angelica has promoted the heretical and false idea that Jews don’t need Jesus Christ for salvation – proven by, among other things, her adherence to the antipopes who teach this – it’s certain that it was not Our Lord Jesus telling her to build a Catholic temple. Rather, it was another evil spirit (one similar to that which she received at the Charismatic event) cryptically telling her to build a “temple” for the New Church religion of the Vatican II sect. It’s very interesting that the top of the Cross on the outside of this “temple” (a temple that Mother Angelica spent about 50 million dollars to build!) was incredibly blown off cleanly by a bolt of lightning during a powerful storm, leaving only a “T,” not the regular Cross. It remains that way to this day.</p>
<p>Moving back to the apostasy promoted by EWTN, Fr. Benedict Groeschel is a huge figure at EWTN. Groeschel has turned away converts, declared that he never “bought” that non-Catholics can’t be saved (a defined dogma), preached in “200 Protestant churches and a hundred synagogues,” and said that the sacraments are not necessary for salvation, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">even denied that Our Lord even said</span> “Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood you shall not have life in you” (John 6:54)![14]</p>
<p>EWTN’s “experts” totally reject the necessity of the Catholic Church for salvation. EWTN’s “experts” inform non-Catholic inquirers – including a Jew who rejects Christ and the wife of an “Orthodox” schismatic wondering about her husband’s obligation to convert – that they are fine for Heaven right where they are.[15]</p>
<p><strong>EWTN also promotes an organization called the Association of Hebrew Catholics</strong> (AHC). The Association of Hebrew Catholics is composed of supposed “converts” from Judaism. They are attempting to create, in effect, a Jewish sect inside the “Catholic Church.” This organization is headed by David Moss, who has been featured on EWTN numerous times. David Moss is the brother of Rosalind Moss, who also has hosted shows on EWTN and is employed by “Catholic Answers.” This AHC – composed of supposed converts from Judaism – promotes that Catholics converted from Judaism may continue to practice the Old Law (an idea solemnly condemned by the Council of Florence).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 50px;">“Ignoring the Church’s teaching that the rituals and observances of the Mosaic law have been abolished with the New Covenant and that it is mortally sinful to observe them, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Moss recommended that the Catholic inquirer ‘go to a local synagogue and watch what they do and listen to it. You can take part in a Seder</span>,’</strong> he added… <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Moss then recommended that Catholics follow suit [that is, follow the practice of ‘Messianic Jews’] by celebrating Passover and Rosh haShanah</strong></span>… This conclusion is supported by an item on AHC’s website entitled: ‘Through the Hebrew Catholic Year: A Collection of Traditions and Prayers for the Jewish Holidays for Catholics.’ <strong>Here AHC advocates a ‘Catholic’ celebration of Rosh haShanah, Yom Kippur, Succoth, Purim, Passover, Shavuoth, and Hanukkah, using prayers ‘adapted from traditional Jewish prayer books</strong>.’”[16]</p>
<p>This is a promotion of mortal sin, heresy and apostasy.</p>
<p>EWTN is unfortunately a very heretical, modernist, false ecumenical network, which mixes apostasy, a promotion of Vatican II, the New Mass and the New Religion with some interesting programming. Here’s an interesting e-mail we received on this issue:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 50px;">“Good morning, <strong>Turned on EWTN this morning</strong>. I find myself occasionally viewing the Novus Ordo service during this my decision process, i.e., what to do (relative to my Catholic Faith). I heard the "main celebrant" Fr. Francis state: '...<strong>the Church never said other Christians will not receive salvation...those that say this are liars or misinformed...the Catholic Church is like a five course meal, if you want the whole meal, come to the Church</strong>..'</p>
<p style="padding-left: 50px;">“The day's homily is available online (I think next day). Perhaps you can use this statement, after you verify, as your "Heresy of the Week." This "doctrine" has gone, real time, to untold numbers. If not included as a "Heresy" installment - send the poor fellow a copy of your "No Salvation" book.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 50px;">Pray for me,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 50px;">G. M.”</p>
<p>We wonder if any of the EWTN supporters who heard or watched the sermon ever deeply considered its implications: what it means about their presence at church, their entire effort to attend “Mass,” etc. We wonder if it hit any of them that this means that being a Catholic, praying the Rosary, going to confession, etc. is pointless.</p>
<p>We certainly hope for the conversion of “Fr.” Francis, but we must say that he is too blinded by his apostasy to realize his foolishness. He is too blinded to realize that he holds that his own “priesthood” – the entire EWTN Network – is a complete waste of time. If you believe what EWTN and “Fr.” Francis do, you would have to be a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>complete idiot</strong></span> to be Catholic. You could just head down to the local Lutheran church, confess your faith in Jesus as Lord, and head on your way.</p>
<p>So don’t be fooled by externals. Heretics have always had externals to one degree or another. Don’t be fooled by those who claim to have some attachment to the Catholic Faith or Our Lord or Our Lady or the Saints, but reject a dogma. Unless they accept the entire truth, they are phonies. “Fr.” Francis sometimes speaks of bringing the young to Christ on his show “Life on the Rock.” Sounds great and devoted, doesn’t it? But then he publicly commented on and praised Benedict XVI’s Christ-denying visit to the synagogue and endorsement of the Jewish religion. He speaks of bringing the young to Christ when he <span style="text-decoration: underline;">believes that Christ is meaningless</span>.</p>
<p>This e-mail shows us again that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">phonies</span> mix an attachment to some things Catholic with a rejection of its truth. They act as if they are devoted to God, and surely say some good and conservative things, but they are abominations in God’s sight.</p>
<p>Since we’re speaking of phonies, mention must be made of “Fr.” John Corapi of EWTN. Those who have seen him know that Corapi gives talks as if he is devoted to Our Lord and the Catholic Faith – “thundering” against sin and defending the Eucharist in his melodramatic fashion. He is an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">utter phony</span>, for he holds that it is all <span style="text-decoration: underline;">meaningless</span>. He holds that you can be a Protestant who completely rejects Our Lady, the Papacy and the Eucharist, or even a Jew who completely rejects Christ.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 50px;"><strong>They are like “whitewashed tombs, which outwardly appear beautiful, but within are full of dead men’s bones and all uncleanness. [They] outwardly appear righteous to men, but within are full of hypocrisy and iniquity</strong>.” (Matthew 23:28)</p>
<p>One of us called “Fr.” Corapi’s secretary once, and asked her: “Is it necessary to be a Catholic to be saved?” She responded with the blunt answer: “No.” One of us then said, “then why be a Catholic?” She said: “Because it is the fullness of truth.” <strong>One of us responded: “But it’s not necessary according to you.” She agreed.</strong> Behold the emptiness, the stupidity and the evil of the Vatican II religion.</p>
