Jews practice the Old Law and reject the Divinity of Christ and the Trinity. The Church teaches the following about the cessation of the Old Law and about all who continue to observe it:
Pope Eugene IV, Council of Florence, 1441, ex cathedra:
“The Holy Roman Church firmly believes, professes and teaches that the matter pertaining to the law of the Old Testament, the Mosaic law, which are divided into ceremonies, sacred rites, sacrifices, and sacraments, because they were established to signify something in the future, although they were suited to the divine worship at that time, after our Lord’s coming had been signified by them, ceased, and the sacraments of the New Testament began; and that whoever, even after the passion, placed hope in these matters of the law and submitted himself to them as necessary for salvation, as if faith in Christ could not save without them, sinned mortally." />

<p>Jews practice the Old Law and reject the Divinity of Christ and the Trinity.  The Church teaches the following about the cessation of the Old Law and about all who continue to observe it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Eugene IV, <em>Council of Florence</em>, 1441, ex cathedra:<br /><strong>“The Holy Roman Church firmly believes, professes and teaches that the matter pertaining to the law of the Old Testament, the Mosaic law, which are divided into ceremonies, sacred rites, sacrifices, and sacraments, </strong>because they were established to signify something in the future, although they were suited to the divine worship at that time, after our Lord’s coming had been signified by them,<strong> ceased</strong>, and the sacraments of the New Testament began; and that whoever, even after the passion, placed hope in these matters of the law and submitted himself to them as necessary for salvation, as if faith in Christ could not save without them, <strong>sinned mortally</strong>.  Yet it does not deny that after the passion of Christ up to the promulgation of the Gospel they could have been observed until they were believed to be in no way necessary for salvation; but after the promulgation of the Gospel <strong>it asserts that they cannot be observed without the loss of eternal salvation.</strong>  <strong>All, therefore, who after that time [the promulgation of the Gospel] observe circumcision and the Sabbath and the other requirements of the law, the holy Roman Church declares alien to the Christian faith and not in the least fit to participate in eternal salvation</strong>.”<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Pope Benedict XIV, <em>Ex Quo Primum</em> (# 61), March 1, 1756:<br /><strong>“The first consideration is that the ceremonies of the Mosaic Law were abrogated by the coming of Christ and that <u>they can no longer be observed without sin after the promulgation of the Gospel</u>.”</strong><a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a></p>
<p>Pope Pius XII, <em>Mystici Corporis Christi</em> (#’s 29-30), June 29, 1943: “And first of all, by the death of our Redeemer, <strong>the New Testament took the place of the Old Law which had been abolished</strong>… on the gibbet of His death<strong> Jesus made void the Law with its decrees</strong> [Eph. 2:15]… establishing the New Testament in His blood shed for the whole human race.  ‘<strong>To such an extent, then,’ says St. Leo the Great, speaking of the Cross of our Lord, ‘was there effected a transfer from the Law to the Gospel, from the Synagogue to the Church</strong>, from many sacrifices to one Victim, that, as our Lord expired, that mystical veil which shut off <strong>the innermost part of the temple and its sacred secret was rent violently from top to bottom.’</strong>  <strong>On the Cross then the Old Law died</strong>, soon to be buried and to be a bearer of death…”<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[3]</a></p>
