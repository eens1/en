First, if you’re not a Catholic, you need to become a traditional Catholic as soon as possible, since there is no salvation outside the one Church Christ has established. The information in this book shows that the Devil’s assault in the final days is on the one Church established by Christ; it is the Devil’s attempt to establish a counterfeit of the true Church. This counterfeit Church has reduced the true Catholic Church to a remnant in the last days." />

<p>First, if you’re not a Catholic, you need to become a traditional Catholic as soon as possible, since there is no salvation outside the one Church Christ has established.  The information in this book shows that the Devil’s assault in the final days is on the one Church established by Christ; it is the Devil’s attempt to establish a counterfeit of the true Church.  This counterfeit Church has reduced the true Catholic Church to a remnant in the last days.  Non-Catholics should contact us for more information about how to convert; the profession of faith for converts to the Catholic Faith is given below.</p>
<p><u>Where to go to Mass or Confession</u><u>?</u></p>
<p>This is probably the most frequent question that we receive and it is the hardest to answer.  This is because there is hardly a solid Catholic priest to be found in the entire country today.  We offer some guidelines here, and our opinion.  Obviously, <strong>no Catholic may attend the <a href="https://vaticancatholic.com/new-mass-traditional-latin-mass/">New Mass</a> under any circumstances</strong>.  No Catholic may receive sacraments from a “priest” ordained in the <a href="https://vaticancatholic.com/new-rite-of-ordination-invalid/">new rite of ordination</a> of Paul VI.</p>
<p>Attending Mass on Sunday and Holy Days is the Church’s law, <strong>which is only obligatory if the Church provides you with a true traditional Mass and a truly Catholic priest within a reasonable distance.  Many Catholics throughout history were in situations where they had no Mass to attend or no Mass which was offered by an acceptable priest.  They were thus forced to stay home.  </strong>Hence, it’s not a sin to stay home on Sundays and sanctify the day by praying your <a href="https://vaticancatholic.com/pray-holy-rosary-virgin-mary/">Rosary</a> if there is no acceptable traditional Mass option in your area, which is the case for many Catholics today in this time of the Great Apostasy.  Those who only have a New Mass in their area would therefore have to stay home on Sundays.  Contact us for more information on this question about possible traditional Mass locations, and consult our website (www.mostholyfamilymonastery.com).</p>
<p>If a person has committed mortal sin and needs to go to <u>Confession</u>, he can go to a Novus Ordo priest who was ordained in the Traditional Rite of Ordination (before 1968) as long as the priest says “I absolve you from your sins in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.”  This can be done if a person needs to go to Confession.</p>
<p><u>Profession of Faith for New Converts and People Leaving the Novus Ordo (the New Mass)</u></p>
<p>If you are a convert, make the Council of Trent’s Profession of Faith for converts.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><u>Profession of Catholic Faith for Converts</u></h3>
<p><em> </em><em>Promulgated solemnly by Pope Pius IV and the Council of Trent</em></p>
<ul>
<li>I, N., with firm faith believe and profess each and every article contained in the symbol of faith which the holy Roman Church uses; namely:</li>
<li>I believe in one God, the Father almighty, maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible; and in</li>
<li>one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, born of the Father before all ages; God from God, light from light, true God from true God; begotten not made, of one substance (consubstantial) with the Father, through whom all things were made;</li>
<li>who for us men and for our salvation came down from heaven, and was made incarnate by the Holy Spirit of the Virgin Mary, and was made man.</li>
<li>He was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate, died, and was buried; and</li>
<li>He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures, and ascended into heaven;</li>
<li>He sits at the right hand of the Father, and He shall come again in glory to judge the living and the dead, and of His kingdom there will be no end.</li>
<li>And I believe in the Holy Ghost, the Lord, and giver of Life, who proceeds from the Father and the Son; who equally with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified; who spoke through the prophets.</li>
<li>And I believe that there is one, holy, Catholic, and apostolic Church.</li>
<li>I confess one baptism for the remission of sins; and I hope for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. Amen.</li>
<li><strong>I resolutely accept and embrace the apostolic and ecclesiastical traditions and the other practices and regulations of that same Church.</strong></li>
<li>In like manner I accept Sacred Scripture according to the meaning which has been held by holy Mother Church and which she now holds. It is Her prerogative to pass judgment on the true meaning and interpretation of Sacred Scripture. And I will never accept or interpret it in a manner different from the unanimous agreement of the Fathers.</li>
<li>I also acknowledge that there are truly and properly seven sacraments of the New Law, instituted by Jesus Christ our Lord, and that they are necessary for the salvation of the human race, although it is not necessary for each individual to receive them all.</li>
<li>I acknowledge that the seven sacraments are: Baptism, Confirmation, Eucharist, Penance, Extreme Unction, Holy Orders, and Matrimony; and that they confer grace; and that of the seven, Baptism, Confirmation, and Holy Orders cannot be repeated without committing a sacrilege.</li>
<li>I also accept and acknowledge the customary and approved rites of the Catholic Church in the solemn administration of these sacraments.</li>
<li>I embrace and accept each and every article on Original Sin and Justification declared and defined in the most holy Council of Trent.</li>
<li>I likewise profess that in Mass a true, proper, and propitiatory sacrifice is offered to God on behalf of the living and the dead, and that the Body and Blood together with the Soul and Divinity of our Lord Jesus Christ is truly, really, and substantially present in the most holy Sacrament of the Eucharist, and that there is a change of the whole substance of the bread into the Body, and of the whole substance of the wine into the Blood; and this change the Catholic Church calls transubstantiation.</li>
<li>I also profess that the whole and entire Christ and a true Sacrament is received under each separate species.</li>
<li>I firmly hold that there is a purgatory, and that the souls detained there are helped by the prayers of the faithful.</li>
<li>I likewise hold that the saints reigning together with Christ should be honored and invoked, that they offer prayers to God on our behalf, and that their relics should be venerated.</li>
<li>I firmly assert that images of Christ, of the Mother of God ever Virgin, and of the other saints should be owned and kept, and that due honor and veneration should be given to them.</li>
<li>I affirm that the power of indulgences was left in the keeping of the Church by Christ, and that the use of indulgences is very beneficial to Christians.</li>
<li>I acknowledge the holy, Catholic, and apostolic Roman Church as the mother and teacher of all churches; and…</li>
<li>I unhesitatingly accept and profess all the doctrines (especially those concerning the primacy of the Roman Pontiff and his infallible teaching authority) handed down, defined, and explained by the sacred canons and ecumenical councils and especially those of this most holy Council of Trent (and by the ecumenical Vatican Council I). And at the same time:</li>
<li><strong>I condemn, reject, and anathematize everything that is contrary to those propositions, and all heresies without exception that have been condemned, rejected, and anathematized by the Church.</strong></li>
<li>I<strong>, N., promise, vow, and swear that, with God’s help, I shall most constantly hold and profess this true Catholic faith, outside which no one can be saved</strong> and which I now freely profess and truly hold. With the help of God, I shall profess it whole and unblemished to my dying breath; and, to the best of my ability, I shall see to it that my subjects or those entrusted to me by virtue of my office hold it, teach it, and preach it. So help me God and His holy Gospel. – <em>end of Profession</em></li>
</ul>
<p>If there is a specific sect to which you belonged, add at the end that you also reject that heretical sect.  If you are a person who has been involved in the Vatican II/Novus Ordo apostasy, you should also make that same profession of Faith from the Council of Trent.  If there were particular dogmas that you denied (such as <a href="https://vaticancatholic.com/outside-the-church-there-is-no-salvation/">Outside the Church There is No Salvation</a>), then add at the end of the Profession that you reject anything contrary to that particular dogma.  The convert would then need to make a Confession to a validly ordained priest (see New Rite of Ordination section) mentioning all mortal sins that he or she has committed, including belonging to and/or spreading and supporting a non-Catholic sect.</p>
<p>People leaving the Novus Ordo also need to make a Confession (to a validly ordained priest, see New Rite of Ordination section) that they attended a non-Catholic service and for however long they attended.  If they participated in other things at the Novus Ordo (e.g. were a lay-minister, dressed immodestly, etc.) or accepted false ecumenism or denied some other dogma, these things should also be mentioned in Confession.  This must be done before receiving Communion at the Traditional Mass (if there is an acceptable one for you to attend in your area).</p>
<p><a href="https://vaticancatholic.com/how-to-perform-a-baptism/"><strong><u>Baptism and Conditional Baptism</u></strong></a>:  The form of baptism is: “I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.”</p>
<p>If there is some doubt about the validity of your baptism, the conditional form of baptism is: “<em>If you are baptized, I do not baptize you again, but if you are not yet baptized [pour water on the head, making sure it touches the skin] I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost</em>.”  Since there are barely any true Catholic priests in the whole country, you can have a Catholic friend perform a conditional baptism, and you can baptize your own children.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Eugene IV, Council of Florence, “Exultate Deo,” 1439: “In case of necessity, however, not only a priest or a deacon, but even a layman or woman, yes even a pagan and a heretic can baptize, so long as he preserves the form of the Church and has the intention of doing what the Church does.”<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, please contact us if you need a summary of the Catholic Catechism.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">PRAYING THE ROSARY AND DEVOTION TO OUR LADY</h3>
<p>For those who are Catholic, <a href="https://vaticancatholic.com/pray-holy-rosary-virgin-mary/">devotion to Our Lady</a> and the Hail Mary are essential.  Catholics must come to learn and understand the power of devotion to Our Lady and the Hail Mary.  This will give them the spiritual armor to ward off the attacks of the Devil, and the light to see the truth of what’s really going on.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>St. Louis De Montfort (+1710): “Blessed Alan de la Roche who was so deeply devoted to the Blessed Virgin had <strong>many revelations from her</strong> and we know that he confirmed the truth of these revelations by a solemn oath.  Three of them stand out with special emphasis: <strong>the first, <u>that if people fail to say the Hail Mary (the Angelic Salutation which has saved the world</u>)</strong> out of carelessness, or because they are lukewarm, or because they hate it, <strong><u>this is a sign that they will probably and indeed shortly be condemned to eternal punishment</u></strong>.”<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a> (<em>The Secret of the Rosary</em>, p. 45)</p>
<p>St. Louis De Montfort (+1710): <strong>“… there are some very sanctifying interior practices for those whom the Holy Ghost calls to high perfection.  These may be expressed in four words: to do all things <em>by</em> Mary, <em>with</em> Mary, <em>in</em> Mary and <em>for</em> Mary; so that we may do them all the more perfectly <em>by</em> Jesus, <em>with</em> Jesus, <em>in</em> Jesus and <em>for</em> Jesus.</strong>”<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[3]</a> (<em>True Devotion to Mary</em> #257)</p>
<p>St. Louis De Montfort (+ c. 1710): “<strong>By this practice [the True Devotion to Mary which he teaches], faithfully observed, you will give Jesus more glory in a month than by any other practice, however difficult, in many years</strong>…”<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4">[4]</a> (<em>True Devotion to Mary</em> #222)</p>
<p>St. Louis De Montfort: “… many others have proved invincibly, from the sentiments of the Fathers (among others, St. Augustine, St. Ephrem, St. Cyril of Jerusalem, St. Germanus, St. John Damascene, St. Anselm, St. Bernard, St. Bernardine, St. Thomas and St. Bonaventure),<strong> that devotion to Mary is necessary to salvation, and that… it is an infallible mark of reprobation to have no esteem and love for the holy Virgin.”<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5">[5]</a></strong> (<em>True Devotion to Mary </em># 40)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Regarding the Holy Rosary, Sister Lucia told Father Fuentes in a famous 1957 interview:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Look, Father, <strong>the Most Holy Virgin in these last times in which we live has given a new efficacy to the recitation of the Holy Rosary</strong>.  She has given this efficacy to such an extent that there is no problem, no matter how difficult it is, whether temporal or above all, spiritual, in the personal life of each one of us, of our families, of the families of the world, or of the religious communities, or even of the life of peoples and nations that cannot be solved by the Rosary.  <strong>There is no problem I tell you, no matter how difficult it is, that we cannot resolve by the prayer of the Holy Rosary.  With the Holy Rosary, we will save ourselves.  We will sanctify ourselves</strong>.  <strong>We will console Our Lord and obtain the salvation of many souls."</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We recommend that Catholics pray the entire 15-decade Rosary each day, if possible.  One set of mysteries at three different times in the day is the recommendation of St. Louis De Montfort as a good way to get that accomplished.  Frankly, many Catholics who are home most of the day are not getting this accomplished, when they easily could.  They are missing out on tremendous graces and the opportunity to help save other souls by their prayers. </p>
<p>We also urge all Catholics to obtain and read the following books.  If one reads and meditates upon the four last things (Death, Judgment, Heaven and Hell), one will most likely avoid sin.  He will avoid the occasions of sin and live a good life.  We consider the following books to be essential for a proper spiritual formation; we believe that one will gain more from reading them than many other books.</p>
