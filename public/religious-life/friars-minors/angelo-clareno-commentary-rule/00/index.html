<article>


<p>Brother Thomas, most dear brother in the Lord, you have often asked me, and many times reminded me quite insistently through others, that under no circumstances should I neglect to write down for you what was the pure, simple, and final intention of Francis, the seraphic man, in the Rule divinely inspired in him by Christ.</p>
<p>For many reasons I have put off doing this, firstly, because of my ignorance and, secondly, because of the obvious answer to what you have requested. The Saint himself, illuminated by a prophetic spirit, has stated and made clear in the fullest and perfect manner his pure understanding and final intention in writing the Rule as he accepted it from Christ. His understanding and intention are found in the Testament, in the Admonitions, in his Letters, and in his other Words, above all in the replies that the holy man, Brother Leo, wrote for his companions when they questioned him about what happened towards the end. What he taught in words he did in deeds, and Christ abundantly confirmed it by innumerable signs, wonders, and miracles worked through him.</p>
<p>The Church of God, unable to err, entered him into the list of saints and approved his life and Rule.</p>
<p>Lest, contrary to the obedience of fraternal love, I seem to ignore the entreaty of your request or seem in an arrogant way to write some kind of novelty, I have decided to write down for you the contents of the whole Rule as they appear in the deeds, words, advice, exhortations, and commands of our most holy father Francis. I will include nothing other than what the Saint himself, with much reliance on prayers, was sure he had received in mercy from Christ for the help of the present and future brothers until the end of the world.</p>
<p>I add some things from the Rules and instructions and equally from the life and doctrine of the saints who lived an apostolic life. From these things it will be clear to those who love the Rule and to those who think differently that he accepted the Rule and its meaning immediately from Christ.</p>
<p>The Rule is fully and completely in accord with the customs and examples of the life of Christ, his Mother, the apostles, and all the perfect saints who preceded him; this Rule has been strengthened by the authority also of the Roman Church and of all the Popes who have been up till today.</p>
<p>Honorius, Bishop, Servant of the servants of God, etc.</p>
<p>Saint Francis was chosen, called, most adequately taught, and illuminated by the Father of mercies for the imitation and renewal of the evangelical perfection and rule of the life of Christ so as to show and preach it to the world by words and example. At the command of Christ who appeared to him personally, he went with his twelve companions to the Vicar of Christ, Lord Innocent III of happy memory.</p>
<p>As far as I remember, the following are the names of the twelve companions of Saint Francis:</p>
<p>Brother Bernard Quintavalle, the first lesser brother after blessed Francis;
Brother Peter was the second;
Brother Giles, the third;
Brother Morico the Short, the fourth;
Brother Sabbatino, the fifth;
Brother Barbaro, the sixth;
Brother John of San Costanzo, the seventh;
Brother Angelo Tancredi, the eighth;
Brother Phillip the Tall, the ninth;
Brother Illuminato, the tenth;
Brother Morico of Bernard Iudante, the eleventh;
Brother John of Capella, the twelfth, who secretly took away the balm prepared for the burial of the body of blessed Francis and who then went and hanged himself with a halter.</p>
<p>With these twelve first brothers, twelve imitating Christ, he presented to the same holy Pontiff the Rule he had written in a simple form as the Saviour himself had taught him. The Rule contained the highest perfections of Christ’s counsels of obedience, poverty, chastity, humility, patience, and charity, as well as the evangelical prohibitions according to the form of life given by the Lord to the apostles and the disciples who were sent out to preach. The most wise Pontiff, advised by God beforehand in a vision, granted most generously what Francis and his companions had requested and promised to give more in the future. He approved the Rule, gave them permission to preach penance, and had them wear small tonsures so that they could preach the word of God freely.</p>
<p>Later, during a General Council celebrated by him in Rome in 1215, he announced to all the prelates that he had given permission for the life and evangelical rule to Saint Francis and to all who followed him willingly.</p>
<p>The Lord Pope Honorius, immediate successor to the aforementioned Pope, in his Bull of approval of the Rule, substantially the same as the first, referred to the permission and approval granted by Pope Innocent III and Honorius, at the request of Saint Francis, and again approved and confirmed the Rule:</p>
<p>Honorius, Bishop, Servant of the servants of God, to his beloved sons, Brother Francis and the other brothers of the Order of the Lesser Brothers, health and apostolic benediction.
The Apostolic See is accustomed to grant the pious requests and favourably to accede to the laudable desires of its petitioners. Therefore, beloved sons in the Lord, attentive to your pious prayers, We confirm with Our Apostolic Authority, and by these words ratify, the Rule of your Order, herein outlined and approved by Our predecessor, Pope Innocent of happy memory, etc.</p>
<p>In the thirteenth year of his conversion to Christ, fully enkindled with a desire for martyrdom, he crossed the sea to preach the Christian faith to the Muslims.</p>
<p>While Saint Francis was overseas, some ministers, with certain brothers who had little confidence in the knowledge and prudence of Francis, presumed to withdraw some things from the Rule and to introduce not a few customs out of harmony with and contrary to the traditions of the founder. On brothers who opposed them, brothers zealous for the pure observance of the Rule, they began to inflict bitter persecutions and injuries; the more they trusted in their own ability, the more secure they felt in despising the simplicity and uprightness of these opponents.</p>
<p>For the rest they did not expect Saint Francis to return to Italy but thought, in view of his having set his soul on the palm of martyrdom and conscious of how strong was this desire, that he would soon go to Christ. But God by a gentle arrangement and in a wonderful manner saw to it that he could in no way find the death he sought with all his strength for the sake of Christ and as a testimony of his faith. This happened so that he might not lack the desired martyrdom and that he might with an abundance of merits give necessary support to his flock, be conformed to Christ, and show to his followers in a fuller manner the way and open the door to the perfect transformation into Christ.</p>
