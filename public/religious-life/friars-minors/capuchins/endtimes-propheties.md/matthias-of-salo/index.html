<p>Source: <a href="https://www.capdox.capuchin.org.au/studies/reform-of-the-church-prophesy-and-apocalypse-in-mattia-da-salo/?hilite=clareno#post-5969-_Toc59381920">capdox.capuchin.org</a></p>
<p>However, to discover the time of the reform Mattia da Salὸ breaks the history of events that led up to his day into new periods of time involving an interpretation of the mission of St Francis and his Order since there is a very strong link between the Franciscan Order and the Church and “a great similarity between the Church and the Franciscan Order”.</p>
<p>He said: “In Ezekiel the reform is represented by the Tau and the Cross, which St John had called the seal of the living God (Rev 7:2).” Because of the reformation of the clergy (here he cites the Theatines as an example) has to reach up to those who are the head through the reformation of the Holy See, that is the Pope and the Cardinals and God never wanted the activity and symbols of this reformation to ever be separated from St Francis. This is what God wants “the acts and symbols of reform to neve be separate from St Francis”. It started on the feast of the Exaltation of the Cross.</p>
<p>“The genuine exaltation of the Cross is the renewal of the Christian people and the Gospel lifestyle in order to receive the fruits of the Holy Cross” in the same way that St Francis received the stigmata, the seal of the living God on the feast of the Cross. Therefore, since “in our days a general reform has started in the Order of St Francis and among the clergy the first exterior sign was the feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross and the Stigmata given to our Holy Father.”</p>
<p>The Angel with the sixth seal cried out in a loud voice (Rev 7:2). At this point Bellintani is talking about his own times and he explains how the reformation of the way of life in the Capuchins has increased this call and “thus God has been moved to pity and Christians induced to do penance, preparing themselves to receive the effects of divine mercy, the principal one of which and the most manifest is the Council of Trent which has opened the gate to reform.”</p>
<p>However, even before that the two witnesses, the Orders of St Francis and of St Domenic, had put perfect observance into practice being like those who “are crying out to the angels who were striking telling them not to harm the earth, the sea and the trees (Rev 7:3). However, when they relaxed the tribulations of the Ottoman Empire and of the Turks came and it was precisely during these tribulations “that the male child of the holy reformation was born.”</p>
<p>Bellintani gives details in his original handwritten codex:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Angel does not represent one person but represents a state or set of persons, like the four angels who were sent to harm the earth and the sea and the trees (Rev 7:1-3) are not only four individuals but all the tribulations that are to come upon the Church from all sides by the hands of the Turks, heretics, evil Christians including heavenly seasons and influences that make the body uncomfortable. To prove this the angel with the seal of the living God does not say to the Angels sent to harm the earth: -Stop until I give the signal but until we have sealed- (Rev 7:3) – Because of this we know that this angel represents all holy men that God has appointed to reform the Church at this time, among whom the most significant were the two Religious Orders of St Dominic and St Francis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The seal of the living God was “the sanctity of life and teaching adopted by these holy men and their disciples along with all the other Pastors and religious who put sin aside by doing penance and living a Christian lifestyle.” This must be made public because the reform has to be obvious and carried out by the support of the cross. The Lord also wanted to impress this seal on the body of St Francis “in such a way that what all possess in a spiritual way he would actually possess spiritually and physically. What happened to him shows everyone that God is at work reforming the Church at all times and in all circumstances.”</p>
<p>Note here the universal prophetic aspect of the figure of St Francis that sounds like something Bonaventure or the Spirituals would say, for the Order of St Francis resembles the Church with Francis at the head as Christ was at the head of the Church. Thus, the tribulations that affected the Church were repeated in the Franciscan Order. Because of his humility St Francis was predestined to “be tormented in a special way by Satan.” Bellintani emphasises this point and develops it by using some reflections borrowed from Angelo Clareno. He says that just as at the beginning of the Church when Christ cast out the ruler of the world by means of holy martyrs, in the same way “in the last days of the Church when the Beast rises once again from the abyss, and the Dragon is released at the end of the thousand years during which he was detained, St Francis, having been given and wearing the seal of the cross, as one of the principal founders of the general reform of the Church went into personal battle with the Beast himself.”</p>
<p>Consequently like Christ:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>he preserved the grandeur and brilliance of his Church in the last days, and as with the moon, that world will be under his feet […] Thus, in the last days, this is how the beauty and spread of the figure of the Seraphic Order will be of service. This will generate hunger which God will gradually satisfy until its new and final birth and resurrections appears in greater glory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From this point on it was easy for him to praise the Capuchin Reform as the “final and most perfect.” Bellintani’s way of thinking did not focus on one person or just on one reform movement as if they were definitive and exclusive. Perhaps it is necessary to correct the traditionally rather hurried reading of the Chronicles of Mattia da Salὸ as being simply propaganda for the Capuchins. His argumentation is more open and less intransigent. He was not sure that the Capuchin Reform was the ultimate Franciscan reform. He does not go looking for signs, historical or spiritual coincidences, the verification of prophetical figures and unambiguous statements. His concept of reform is much vaster and more open and goes in search of a universal vision that is apocalyptic and eschatological. Even though he makes use of “trustworthy revelations” that God bestowed on certain holy friars as a guarantee that the Capuchin Reform was pleasing to God, and tells of “secret miracles” that support the Capuchins, this is true even if many prophesies in the past, such as those of Giacomo de Massa, Angelo Clareno, Giovanni da Parma, Bernardino da Quintavalle and Joachim of Fiore seem to apply specifically to the Capuchins, only God knows if the Capuchins are the final, perfect reform of the Franciscans or just a sign, a beginning of a greater reform in the future. For now (he says) there are divisions among the Capuchins who live without privileges observing the Rule and Testament and the Observants and Conventuals who accept privileges:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But if as part of the tribulations threatened by God in revelations given to holy men, after the heresies there are to follow other important events before the reform of the Church is perfected this could also happen within the Franciscan Order. Only God knows. We may well have to wait for the pastor and guide of the Capuchin Reform that Christ has promised to appear for him to perfect the Order as well as the Church following extreme tribulations and restore their beauty as the Prophets and St John the Evangelist have promised the Spouse would do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In order to put more emphasis on this concept Bellintani tells the story of a vision, that had already been told by Francesco Ripanti da Jesi, without acknowledging this. A friar saw terrifying armies descend on Christianity causing amazing destruction and killing some people and pillaging sacred objects. The fervent friars “fled into the desert” where St Francis guided them and preached to them exhorting them to persevere while waiting for the right time in the desert. If someone disobeyed and went off to preach the faith, he died immediately “without deriving the fruit or honour from the faith”. While the friars armed themselves with the spirit of God in the desert, “the entire desolate Church arrived.” At the right time, the Holy Spirit descended upon twelve of those refugees in the desert and they and the others were filled with heavenly fire and they went forth and preached to the infidels, and “led back all the Mohammedans to the faith of Christ and filled the Church, which growing in perfection, shone with wonderful beauty.” This vision is in line with the image of the woman in the desert who was nourished by God.</p>
<p>Another prophesy or vision that Bellintani must have found in the Italian codex of Clareno that is held in Genoa speaks of how while a naval battle was raging on a stormy sea (a symbol of the history of the world) the smallest vessel in which St Francis was travelling was the fastest, that is the one “that contained those who observe the Rule as St Francis lived it.” It was small because there are a few on board since those who observe the Rule perfectly living in poverty and humility are few in comparison to the wicked. The conflict represents how “by means of exterior conflicts and by transgressions” the demons prevail in Christ’s Church, “like St John said that the beast was allowed to advance on the Saints and defeat them. However, St Francis’ little ship will not be defeated. Indeed, it will defeat the army of the Tartars which is filled with evil spirits, because this ship is devoting itself to the reform of the Church and in bringing the Turks who have afflicted Christians to the holy faith, just as Christ revealed to St Francis”.</p>
<p>It is in this context that Bellintani, during an exalted moment in his meditation, audaciously tells the friars the main reason for the dissolution of an Observant Religious Order which is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the pardon superiors extend to delinquents out of human respect. In this case it is a sign of ambition in the hearts of superiors who, being afraid that if they punish transgressors, they would displease the friars so they go ahead pretending and closing their eyes under the pretext of showing mercy. As a consequence, two great unacceptable things follow on. Firstly, transgressors remain unpunished and so their disciples are not afraid to do the same. Secondly, they hide defects in the Order which upsets many, starts dissention and brings on hatred both towards the superiors and towards those whom they are supporting. What is more than anything else, this results in great confusion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He means to apply this to the time of the Capuchin Reform as he says that after seventy years “it is gradually relaxing the customary sanctity that glowed in the early founders of the Reform.” The same appears in another comment that he makes on contemporary history. “When the reform that is taking place in our time begun, by means of the Council of Trent, our Divine Majesty provided a clear sign that the sacred Council pleased him very much when he gave us victory over the Turks in order to demonstrate clearly that in so far as the reform progressed, the strength of the enemy would fall behind.” When he mentions that during the Generalate of Giovanni M. da Tusa in 1582, there was a reform in the calendar that became known as the “Gregorian Calendar” he adds comments that are almost cabalistic as he plays with numbers and symbolic coincidences, for,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>going back ten days, to the first day of the previous course that was the Feast of St Francis, when he put an end to his former ways and began a new and reformed way of life it was noteworthy that by calling the day after the Feast of St Francis the fifteenth, whereas it was the fifth, we skip over the seventh which was the day of the victory over the Turks [7 October 1571] as if that day had been destroyed. This means that God fulfilled what was in the Apocalypse where it says that one of the heads of the Beast appeared to be dead, but then it came back to life. (Rev 13:3).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mattia da Salὸ is not making a mistake in applying various interpretations to contemporary events. He believed that the Apocalypse had continual outcomes in history especially with regard to the Capuchins. Ochino’s fall, that “appeared to be the end of the Order”, was the result of the four angels of harm being set free, in order to imprint the seal of the living God on the foreheads of his servants. The address that Cardinal Severina delivered before Paul III in defence of the Capuchins was full of references to the Apocalypse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most Holy father, faults, scandals and dangers must be removed, taken away and remedied […] and this is the responsibility of the Holy Sea, against which the gates of hell will not prevail […] it will close them with its strength and the help of providence, so that the beast who wanted to overcome the saints could not rise from the abyss. (Rev 13:7), or send unclean frogs (Rev 16:13) to spoil the beauty of Christianity, or send locusts to devour the grass of the earth and prevent good actions from being performed. (Rev 9:2-4).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When he speaks about the two Capuchin protomartyrs, Giovanni Pugliese and Giovanni Spagnolo, he argues that they are martyrs who belong in the time of the Antichrist, because, “they were full of inner strength and strength of faith, whereas the ancient martyrs showed exterior sign so as to confound the tyrants.”
His method of applications becomes more emphatic and detailed: “As the time approached for the male child of the general reform to be born the beautiful peace of the Church and especially of Italy where its head resided, was disturbed by a great deal of civil wars and internal discord […] which provided the enemy, the cruel head of the beast, with strength and opportunity to attack and put them beneath his feet.” These disasters lasted from 1490-1528, and the pains of birth, the last ones, were the most severe. In fact, Luther appeared:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>to whom was given the key of the well of the abyss and he opened it. He released the dark smoke of error that took away the splendour of the sun from so many people, darkening in their eyes the clarity of Papal authority and Gospel truth. The smoke was the origin of the abominable locusts who scourged the Church with new errors, disturbed people and sowed cruel discord and wars and brought about the ruin of those who did not have the seal of the living Gd on their forehead and were living a worldly lifestyle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bellintani sees the extreme pain of giving birth in the defeat of the King of France at Pavia in 1525, in the alliance of the Pope with Venice and the King of France against the Emperor, the antipapal factions against Clement VII which took place precisely as the time of Giovanni da Fano persecuting the Capuchins and most of all in the “Sack of Rome” which he describes in very dramatic pages, indicating the coincidence of events as a sign of divine judgement of the Church:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Having observed carefully the threats that the prophets made against Jerusalem and Babylon we realise (from the total destruction that came from outside) that the situation in Rome was worse than the punishments that had been predicted for them for whereas this ought to be Jerusalem where sanctity and the reign of Christ prevails, but where the confusion of vice is reigning. Babylon was destroyed beyond repair but the walls of Jerusalem may be repaired by reform carried out by the grace of God by hard-working Christians as is symbolise by the building of the new St Peter’s Church.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mattia da Salὸ devised the similarity between “the pains of giving birth and the trials of the reform from the fact that, after the Sack of Rome”, Clement VII fled to Orvieto by night, and, on 3 July, “issued a Bull which was the foundation and strength of the Capuchin Reform.” The instrument of reform was the Council of Trent which had set it on its way, validated it and authenticated all of the expressions of “holy reform” that appeared not only in the Capuchins, but in many other ways among the regular and secular clergy.</p>
<p>All the evil that happened to the Church was transformed into good and what had been “a dark night” was changed into “clear day” because the reform had overcome the Roman Court:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now Rome that was holy because of its status and because of the relics of the Saints, is also holy because the virtues it practices which shine out and increase every day and where there was no word that was more suspect than the word reform now there is no word so respected and valued. What is more, this shows that God has created the spirit of reform so that nothing is more desirable or active with new expression of reform coming up each day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was indeed the time when reform became a significant feature of the Church, one of the signs of which was the Capuchin Reform. This reform did not stop within the Church. The waves of tribulation and spiritual renewal always continued to become stronger as she suffered the pains of giving birth.</p>
<p>Thus Bellintani’s vision remains open to an eschatological future in a Ecclesia semper reformanda, until the glorious return of the Lord.</p>
