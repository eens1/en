<p>Mature Brother – At different times, he wrote three. The first was written around the third year of his conversion and contained twenty-four chapters. It was approved by Innocent III without a Bull, as Pope Honorius mentions in the foreword to our Rule. He wrote the second around the eleventh year of his conversion. It was approved by the same Pope with a Bull, and as the Book of Conformities states, it was concealed or destroyed by Brother Elias. He wrote the third around the twelfth year of his conversion, nullifying many things and abbreviating others. It was approved by Pope Honorius, as appears in the foreword.</p>
