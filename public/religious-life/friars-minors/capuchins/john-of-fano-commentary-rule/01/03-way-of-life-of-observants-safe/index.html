<li>Scrupulous Brother – [&hellip;] I would like to know whether the way of life followed by our brothers known as the Observants (among whom I am presently living) follows the mind of Saint Francis and can be followed safely according to the conscience of the brothers.</li>
</ol>
<p>Mature Brother – What makes you have doubts?</p>
<p>Scrupulous Brother – The four things which you already mentioned to me before. The more I saw the novel way of life and continual change, the more I began to have doubts, especially when, following your explanation, I saw that you had left the “family” and gone to the Capuchin reform.</p>
<p>Firstly, there are the distortions and interpretations of the Rule, which are completely prohibited by Saint Francis, who wanted the Rule to be understood and lived to the letter without correspondence or privilege being asked from the Roman Court.</p>
<p>Secondly, there is undue recourse to spiritual friends and procurators, and the quick and indiscreet acceptance of money for Masses, services rendered, sales, quests, and other things, as often happens, and many other procedures that are completely forbidden by the Rule and by Saint Francis; annual rents and the like.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the general relaxation in the way of life concerning the Rule and, in divine matters, relaxed observance of the main vows, in buildings, vestments, food and clothing, excess hoarding of the necessities of life, in the regulations of the Order, in conduct inside and outside the Order, etc.</p>
<p>Fourthly, there is such a variety of reforms and changes of habits, which has been going on for a long time within the Order. It is a sure thing that if one had wanted to observe the Rule where this was going on, so many splits and factions would have made it impossible, and this makes me very fearful.</p>
<p>Many statements and declarations were made concerning these things in the other Dialogue, and they appeared to me to establish satisfaction and peace, but I now find myself in greater doubt and fear than ever because of the above-mentioned things, especially your transfer.</p>
<ol start="510">
<li>Mature Brother – Your doubts are justified and not without basis, and so I will deal with what I can rightly understand in them. There is no doubt that because of a corrupt condition and tendency towards human weakness, it is difficult to find a person or situation that is completely irreprehensible or immune from all fault. Nor can one also deny that among those who profess evangelical perfection, there are some who are imperfect.</li>
</ol>
<p>But listen to me, I beg of you: on the former occasion when we were discussing these matters (if you remember well), I told you that the way of life within the Observant family, according to the way it was lived by the most saintly reforming fathers, namely John Capistran, Saint Bernadine, and others, was good and safe, and those who followed this were assured of their salvation. This was always my intention in the other Dialogue (as was quite clear there), namely to commend the regulated and dutiful way of life of the above-mentioned holy men and not the many special cases, which have occurred especially in recent times. Although some have twisted my statements as being applicable to all cases, including those in recent times, in order to hide relaxations, they will not be excused before the judgment seat of God.</p>
<p>Scrupulous Brother – Nonetheless, Father, your words fill me with greater doubt and fear, for indeed in the other Dialogue your most compelling intent was very clearly evident. Those who attach a different and false meaning to your intentions in order to satisfy their weaknesses make a serious error. However, your transfer, way of life, and wearing of the garb of reform force me to ask you to instruct me clearly what I should do to be saved.</p>
<ol start="511">
<li>Mature Brother – I agree, but I first want to clear up the four above-mentioned doubts for you and in clarifying the fourth, once again respond to your request.</li>
</ol>
<p>To the first regarding declarations and glosses, I reply that I firmly hold that the declarations of the Supreme Pontiffs and of the doctors of the Order regarding the Rule are to be accepted and observed with all reverence since in no way do they take away from the purity of the Rule. What is more, it would be a damnable error to hold the opposite. If the Church were to err in matters concerning good conduct, it would be shameful because error in behavior brings about evil, as Augustine of Ancona says in De potestate papae, since it will either become an occasion of sin or prevent the brothers from practicing the perfection of the Rule as they have promised. Then the Church would not always be holy, which it is very improper to say.</p>
<p>When you say that Saint Francis prohibited glosses on the Rule, I say that he did not take away the authority of the Supreme Pontiffs to solve doubts regarding the Rule that might arise over time. That is why he submitted the Rule to the Apostolic See. If it were otherwise, there would be no Rule or observance without the authority and approval of the Apostolic See. Augustine says this when speaking of the Gospel in Contra fundamentum Manichei: “I would not believe in the Gospel if I did not believe that it had been approved by the holy Church.”</p>
<ol start="512">
<li>However, we should believe that Saint Francis prohibited the glosses which are made by imperfect and weak people against the solid meaning of the Rule and against the precepts, and glosses that do not clarify the Rule but change it or obscure it and relax the way of life.</li>
</ol>
<p>After the declarations of the Supreme Pontiffs come those of the doctors of the Order, who have a greater understanding and more perfect observance of the Rule, and these are to be adhered to and observed.</p>
<p>Note that among all the declarations, two are outstanding both because of their standing in law and for their conformity to the Rule, that is the one by Nicholas III, Exiit. De verborum significatione, and the one by Clement V, Exivi de Paradiso. These have always been held in high regard among the good and zealous brothers to whom Bartolo refers in his Minorica.</p>
