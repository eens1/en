<p>Scrupulous Brother – Even though in the previous Dialogue I was educated about the things that are necessary for the salvation of the brothers, I ask that for my greater satisfaction you tell me whether living by this Rule and profession is safe and whether those who observe it can be certain about their personal salvation.</p>
<p>Mature Brother – My son, as I told you on the previous occasion, hold fast to the conviction that this way of life and the Rule are very safe and whoever observes it will undoubtedly be saved. The reason is that this Rule was not discovered in a human manner but revealed by God, taken from the Gospel, and based on it. Although every word is not taken from the Gospel literally, they take their meaning from the Gospel. Consider any one of them and you will see that this is the case. This is the meaning of the vision of the breadcrumbs as we shall see later.</p>
<p>In the Book of Conformities (under Franciscus legislator), you will see that the Lord said many times to Blessed Francis that He had composed this Rule and not Francis, and that it contained nothing belonging to him but was all from Christ. He said this in the presence of Brother Elias and the ministers who opposed him. The Lord wished to dictate both the first and second edition of the Rule, and so it is more holy and right inasmuch as Jesus Christ, the saint of saints and the highest wisdom, composed it, reformed it, and dictated it.</p>
<p>Pope Honorius confirmed this when he said in the presence of Blessed Francis, Brother Leo, and Brother Bonzio: “Blessed is he who, through divine grace, faithfully and devotedly observes this Rule since everything that is written in it is perfect, Catholic, and holy.”</p>
<p>This is confirmed in Exiit, de verborum significatione: haec est apud Deum et Patrem etc. Saint Bonaventure says: “It is a great consolation to those who profess this Rule that they profess what the Lord said to the apostles when he commissioned them to preach.”</p>
<p>Since Christ is the mirror and example of all the virtues which lead to perfection and Paradise, as He says: “Whoever follows me does not walk in the dark,” and “If you wish to be perfect, go, sell all that you have, and give it to the poor, and follow me,” as can be seen clearly, this Rule teaches the following of Christ and so is all the more perfect. At the beginning of the Rule, it says: “The Rule and life of the Friars Minor is this, to observe the holy gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.”</p>
<p>John Pecham says: “It was the intention of Blessed Francis to commit evangelical holiness to his sons, that is the life of Christ and His apostles, inasmuch as human frailty would permit” because His life is perfectly described in the Gospel. So it says: “and to observe the holy gospel,” as if to say: “O you who for love of Him who died for our salvation have separated your hearts from love of the world and of yourselves, and taken up your cross as apostolic and humble men, come, so that your life and Rule may be the observance of the holy Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, imitating His life as it is described in the Gospel.”</p>
<p>Thus, Blessed Francis gave praise that the eternal Father had assigned this Order to the Son of God in these last times and that He wanted it to be more modeled on Him than those which had gone before, and that Christ had revealed that it should be known as the Order of Friars Minor to fulfill the words of Christ in Chapter 25 of the Gospel according to Matthew: “What you do to one of the least of my children, you do to me,” as Saint Bonaventure says.</p>
<p>The Pisan says that the Lord intended that these words be applied literally to the Friars Minor.</p>
<p>Because of this, the Rule is based on the authority and approval of the Supreme Pontiffs and of Holy Mother Church (as is stated at the beginning and end of the Rule), for whom it is lawful to approve, confirm, comment, and declare Rules that exist within the Church.</p>
