<h2 id="whether-the-environment-of-the-franciscan-rule-is-safe-for-salvation">Whether the environment of the Franciscan Rule is safe for salvation</h2>
<p>Scrupulous Brother – Even though in the previous Dialogue I was educated about the things that are necessary for the salvation of the brothers, I ask that for my greater satisfaction you tell me whether living by this Rule and profession is safe and whether those who observe it can be certain about their personal salvation.</p>
<p>Mature Brother – My son, as I told you on the previous occasion, hold fast to the conviction that this way of life and the Rule are very safe and whoever observes it will undoubtedly be saved. The reason is that this Rule was not discovered in a human manner but revealed by God, taken from the Gospel, and based on it. Although every word is not taken from the Gospel literally, they take their meaning from the Gospel. Consider any one of them and you will see that this is the case. This is the meaning of the vision of the breadcrumbs as we shall see later.</p>
<p>In the Book of Conformities (under Franciscus legislator), you will see that the Lord said many times to Blessed Francis that He had composed this Rule and not Francis, and that it contained nothing belonging to him but was all from Christ. He said this in the presence of Brother Elias and the ministers who opposed him. The Lord wished to dictate both the first and second edition of the Rule, and so it is more holy and right inasmuch as Jesus Christ, the saint of saints and the highest wisdom, composed it, reformed it, and dictated it.</p>
<p>Pope Honorius confirmed this when he said in the presence of Blessed Francis, Brother Leo, and Brother Bonzio: “Blessed is he who, through divine grace, faithfully and devotedly observes this Rule since everything that is written in it is perfect, Catholic, and holy.”</p>
<p>This is confirmed in Exiit, de verborum significatione: haec est apud Deum et Patrem etc. Saint Bonaventure says: “It is a great consolation to those who profess this Rule that they profess what the Lord said to the apostles when he commissioned them to preach.”</p>
<p>Since Christ is the mirror and example of all the virtues which lead to perfection and Paradise, as He says: “Whoever follows me does not walk in the dark,” and “If you wish to be perfect, go, sell all that you have, and give it to the poor, and follow me,” as can be seen clearly, this Rule teaches the following of Christ and so is all the more perfect. At the beginning of the Rule, it says: “The Rule and life of the Friars Minor is this, to observe the holy gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.”</p>
<p>John Pecham says: “It was the intention of Blessed Francis to commit evangelical holiness to his sons, that is the life of Christ and His apostles, inasmuch as human frailty would permit” because His life is perfectly described in the Gospel. So it says: “and to observe the holy gospel,” as if to say: “O you who for love of Him who died for our salvation have separated your hearts from love of the world and of yourselves, and taken up your cross as apostolic and humble men, come, so that your life and Rule may be the observance of the holy Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, imitating His life as it is described in the Gospel.”</p>
<p>Thus, Blessed Francis gave praise that the eternal Father had assigned this Order to the Son of God in these last times and that He wanted it to be more modeled on Him than those which had gone before, and that Christ had revealed that it should be known as the Order of Friars Minor to fulfill the words of Christ in Chapter 25 of the Gospel according to Matthew: “What you do to one of the least of my children, you do to me,” as Saint Bonaventure says.</p>
<p>The Pisan says that the Lord intended that these words be applied literally to the Friars Minor.</p>
<p>Because of this, the Rule is based on the authority and approval of the Supreme Pontiffs and of Holy Mother Church (as is stated at the beginning and end of the Rule), for whom it is lawful to approve, confirm, comment, and declare Rules that exist within the Church.</p>
<h2 id="how-many-rules-did-saint-francis-write">How many Rules did Saint Francis Write?</h2>
<p>Scrupulous Brother – Did our Father Saint Francis write more than one Rule?</p>
<p>Mature Brother – At different times, he wrote three. The first was written around the third year of his conversion and contained twenty-four chapters. It was approved by Innocent III without a Bull, as Pope Honorius mentions in the foreword to our Rule. He wrote the second around the eleventh year of his conversion. It was approved by the same Pope with a Bull, and as the Book of Conformities states, it was concealed or destroyed by Brother Elias. He wrote the third around the twelfth year of his conversion, nullifying many things and abbreviating others. It was approved by Pope Honorius, as appears in the foreword.</p>
<h2 id="whether-the-way-of-life-of-the-observants-is-safe-and-according-to-the-mind-of-saint-francis">Whether the way of life of the Observants is safe and according to the mind of Saint Francis</h2>
<p>Scrupulous Brother – [&hellip;] I would like to know whether the way of life followed by our brothers known as the Observants (among whom I am presently living) follows the mind of Saint Francis and can be followed safely according to the conscience of the brothers.</p>
<p>Mature Brother – What makes you have doubts?</p>
<p>Scrupulous Brother – The four things which you already mentioned to me before. The more I saw the novel way of life and continual change, the more I began to have doubts, especially when, following your explanation, I saw that you had left the “family” and gone to the Capuchin reform.</p>
<p>Firstly, there are the distortions and interpretations of the Rule, which are completely prohibited by Saint Francis, who wanted the Rule to be understood and lived to the letter without correspondence or privilege being asked from the Roman Court.</p>
<p>Secondly, there is undue recourse to spiritual friends and procurators, and the quick and indiscreet acceptance of money for Masses, services rendered, sales, quests, and other things, as often happens, and many other procedures that are completely forbidden by the Rule and by Saint Francis; annual rents and the like.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the general relaxation in the way of life concerning the Rule and, in divine matters, relaxed observance of the main vows, in buildings, vestments, food and clothing, excess hoarding of the necessities of life, in the regulations of the Order, in conduct inside and outside the Order, etc.</p>
<p>Fourthly, there is such a variety of reforms and changes of habits, which has been going on for a long time within the Order. It is a sure thing that if one had wanted to observe the Rule where this was going on, so many splits and factions would have made it impossible, and this makes me very fearful.</p>
<p>Many statements and declarations were made concerning these things in the other Dialogue, and they appeared to me to establish satisfaction and peace, but I now find myself in greater doubt and fear than ever because of the above-mentioned things, especially your transfer.</p>
<p>Mature Brother – Your doubts are justified and not without basis, and so I will deal with what I can rightly understand in them. There is no doubt that because of a corrupt condition and tendency towards human weakness, it is difficult to find a person or situation that is completely irreprehensible or immune from all fault. Nor can one also deny that among those who profess evangelical perfection, there are some who are imperfect.</p>
<p>But listen to me, I beg of you: on the former occasion when we were discussing these matters (if you remember well), I told you that the way of life within the Observant family, according to the way it was lived by the most saintly reforming fathers, namely John Capistran, Saint Bernadine, and others, was good and safe, and those who followed this were assured of their salvation. This was always my intention in the other Dialogue (as was quite clear there), namely to commend the regulated and dutiful way of life of the above-mentioned holy men and not the many special cases, which have occurred especially in recent times. Although some have twisted my statements as being applicable to all cases, including those in recent times, in order to hide relaxations, they will not be excused before the judgment seat of God.</p>
<p>Scrupulous Brother – Nonetheless, Father, your words fill me with greater doubt and fear, for indeed in the other Dialogue your most compelling intent was very clearly evident. Those who attach a different and false meaning to your intentions in order to satisfy their weaknesses make a serious error. However, your transfer, way of life, and wearing of the garb of reform force me to ask you to instruct me clearly what I should do to be saved.</p>
<p>Mature Brother – I agree, but I first want to clear up the four above-mentioned doubts for you and in clarifying the fourth, once again respond to your request.</p>
<p>To the first regarding declarations and glosses, I reply that I firmly hold that the declarations of the Supreme Pontiffs and of the doctors of the Order regarding the Rule are to be accepted and observed with all reverence since in no way do they take away from the purity of the Rule. What is more, it would be a damnable error to hold the opposite. If the Church were to err in matters concerning good conduct, it would be shameful because error in behavior brings about evil, as Augustine of Ancona says in De potestate papae, since it will either become an occasion of sin or prevent the brothers from practicing the perfection of the Rule as they have promised. Then the Church would not always be holy, which it is very improper to say.</p>
<p>When you say that Saint Francis prohibited glosses on the Rule, I say that he did not take away the authority of the Supreme Pontiffs to solve doubts regarding the Rule that might arise over time. That is why he submitted the Rule to the Apostolic See. If it were otherwise, there would be no Rule or observance without the authority and approval of the Apostolic See. Augustine says this when speaking of the Gospel in Contra fundamentum Manichei: “I would not believe in the Gospel if I did not believe that it had been approved by the holy Church.”</p>
<p>However, we should believe that Saint Francis prohibited the glosses which are made by imperfect and weak people against the solid meaning of the Rule and against the precepts, and glosses that do not clarify the Rule but change it or obscure it and relax the way of life.</p>
<p>After the declarations of the Supreme Pontiffs come those of the doctors of the Order, who have a greater understanding and more perfect observance of the Rule, and these are to be adhered to and observed.</p>
<p>Note that among all the declarations, two are outstanding both because of their standing in law and for their conformity to the Rule, that is the one by Nicholas III, Exiit. De verborum significatione, and the one by Clement V, Exivi de Paradiso. These have always been held in high regard among the good and zealous brothers to whom Bartolo refers in his Minorica.</p>
<h2 id="the-intention-of-saint-francis-regarding-the-interpretation-of-the-rule">The intention of Saint Francis regarding the interpretation of the Rule</h2>
<p>Scrupulous Brother – What do you think was Saint Francis’ intention with respect to the interpretation of the Rule?</p>
<p>Mature Brother – Note well that Saint Francis said in his Testament that he wanted the Rule to be understood simply and observed in the same way. He says that the Lord revealed it to him. Although with good intentions, the Pope said that we were not bound to observe the Testament, we must still hold it in the highest respect and observe it where possible, as Alvarus says, since that is where our Father sets out his intentions. It is credible that he wrote the Testament and the Rule through the same divine inspiration at the end of his life when he was perfect in virtue. This is what Alvarus says. Whoever does not esteem the Testament and is not careful to observe it as far as possible shows little love for such a Father and little regard for his legacy and blessing. Therefore, at their General Chapter, the Capuchins decreed that the Testament be observed.</p>
<p>The Lord said the same thing when Brother Elias and other brothers were present who did not want to accept the Rule.</p>
<p>This is so because the whole observance of the Rule consists in knowing God and His beloved Son, in loving Him and carrying Him in our hearts and imitating His life. Indeed, the Rule says that we should observe the holy Gospel since the life of Christ is described perfectly in the Gospel, which the brother should keep before his eyes and be found to be obedient, poor, and chaste simply out of the love he has for God and sinners.</p>
<p>This Rule, then, imposes observing the Gospel, that is, placing our Lord Jesus Christ and His life before the mind’s eyes, striving to know and love Him, and always desiring His presence and imitating His life in perfect obedience, poverty, and chastity, as much as human frailty will allow. This is the real meaning of the words: The Rule and life of the Friars Minor is this: to observe the holy Gospel, etc. Whoever looks for any other meaning neither understands the Rule properly nor observes it.</p>
<p>Although many declarations have been written, the Rule has never been observed by those not gifted by God with special love for Christ, who have been invited and inflamed to love Him and imitate Him. As we have said, this is what observing the Rule means. Therefore, as the Gospel law is a law of love and grace and of the manifestation of the Son of God, who became man and died for sinners, thus this Rule is a Rule of love and contains within itself the Spirit of Christ and His grace. Whoever wishes to understand it must necessarily have the Spirit of Christ in him, which is nothing else but an ardent desire to know, love, imitate, embrace, and carry Him in our heart.</p>
<p>Since the Gospel, which is the law of love, cannot enter our heart except by means of love, because no act of love can be performed except out of love, as was evident in the Saints of the early Church and the martyrs, all of whom were gospel people because they observed the whole Gospel out of love so that they were afraid of neither torture nor death, so our Rule, being a Rule of love, cannot be really understood in our hearts except through love. Therefore, those who only look for the letter are motivated by fear alone, since they are afraid of punishment, confusion, or damnation in the next life and are inspired only sometimes by hope. These act like the Jews, who, since they only followed the letter of the law out of hope and fear, never reached a perfect understanding of the law. Those who understand the letter of the law are the same.</p>
<p>Therefore, the grace and Spirit of Christ suffice to understand and observe the Rule which He composed. To achieve this, it is required that we adopt the way of loving which the Lord Jesus Christ brought to us, a love which (once every vestige of divinity had been removed from Him) made Him so humble that it not only led to Him holding everything in contempt but even to a cruel and shameful death.</p>
<p>If we take on this kind of love as our Lord Jesus Christ did, we too will understand the Rule and observe it.</p>
<p>Therefore, while the soul is joined to Christ by love, it will always be fixed on the observance of the Rule. Furthermore, it will never be at peace or contented until it has reached the highest degree of perfect obedience, poverty, and chastity, and will think of nothing but perfecting these things completely (as far as possible) as the most kind Lord did Himself. Look at how He observed them and see how His true lover will strive to observe them simply.</p>
<p>Thus, I conclude, regarding this first doubt, saying that Saint Francis prohibited glosses on the Rule since he wanted Christ’s life to be its gloss, as he said: “Look to Christ and to me and do likewise.”</p>
<p>See below in chapters four and six for the second doubt.</p>
<p>Regarding the third doubt concerning relaxations, I say that this was partly the reason for my changing, which was such a surprise for you. You should understand that in these highly dangerous times this is very frightening because we observe that fervor, charity, and the love of God has grown cold in all states of life. If a person has to be vigilant in all states of life, how much more should they be attentive in our state of life to the perfection of the Rule, the obligation of solemn vows, the intention of our father Saint Francis when writing the Rule, and also to our being designated observants. So, with every endeavor, we should seek out a method and a path to remove all impediments to the observance of our profession, and to act otherwise would be to despise the Rule and the statutes which have been set down for the better observance of the Rule and consequently to despise our own salvation. Therefore, not only do those brothers commit mortal sins who despise serious matters, but also those who despise small things fall into more serious matters.</p>
<p>In this way, such people become lax and move away from the observance of the Rule. When they are careless over lesser matters, they will despise small and serious matters and fall. Thus, those wretched people fall with their eyes open and perish. Because of this, they show greater ingratitude for the divine gifts. The Almighty God has lifted them up to a sublime state through these gifts. Saint Paul had these people in mind when he wrote to the Hebrews: My dear faithful, how much more and heavier punishment will be meted out to the one who, by sinning, has trampled on the Son of God out of contempt.</p>
<p>The Lord complains about such as these in chapter 10 of Jeremiah: What is the meaning that my beloved hath wrought much wickedness in my house? Usually, such people become worse and incorrigible, as Augustine says: To Vincent the Donatist: Since the time when I began to serve Him, just as I have hardly found any men better than those who have done well in monasteries, so I have not found any men worse than monks who have fallen. This is what he says.</p>
<p>Indeed, the motivation of those who want to live against regular observance is evil and perverse, having no respect for regulations or statutes, not wishing to reform in any way. Thus, if they continue in this manner, they can only come to a damnable death since they not only break the solemn vows which they have promised but also (not out of ignorance but malice) deliberately refuse to accept other things necessary for their salvation. They cannot be saved unless they live according to the observance of the Rule, which they have promised and knowingly break.</p>
<p>From this, we can understand the vision that Saint Francis saw: It seemed to him that he had very delicate crumbs of bread in his hand which he had to give to the brothers, but because they were so small, he thought that they would fall. He heard a voice that said: “Francis, form the crumbs into a host and give them to the brothers.” When he did this, he observed that those who despised them or picked them up without devotion immediately became lepers. When he understood the vision, he heard the voice once again saying: “Francis, the crumbs are the words of the Gospel, the host is the Rule, and the leper represents evil.”</p>
<p>Once Jesus Christ appeared to Brother Leo, the companion of Saint Francis, complaining about three things concerning the brothers: “Firstly, they do not recognize My gifts. I bestow gifts upon them with such abundance, and they do not have to weary themselves with sowing or reaping, etc., and they live with such ease. However, they are ungrateful and lazy and murmur continually. Secondly, they provoke one another to anger. Thirdly, they do not pardon injuries or make peace.”</p>
<p>Blessed Francis also said to Brother Leo that the Lord had revealed to him how He had the greatest confidence in this Order and would pardon the world because of the merits of the Order. However, with the passage of time, the brothers departed from the path that had been shown to them and provoked the Lord’s anger. The Lord summoned the devils against the Order, and they placed such scandal between them and the world that the world almost lost faith in them.</p>
<p>He also said that the Lord had revealed to him that the evil brother would continue to be malicious, leave the Order, and become bewildered.</p>
<p>Blessed Francis saw our Lord Jesus Christ yet again with wounds that appeared to be bleeding, and He said to him: “Your brothers have done this to me through transgressions of the Rule that I gave to you.”</p>
<p>After his death, Blessed Francis appeared with wings and claws like an eagle, saying that the wings were to help good brothers and to carry their souls into heaven, and the claws were to punish the bad and reprobate brothers. We read in the Book of Conformities under Franciscus fecundator, in vita fratris Leonis.</p>
<p>During the time of the Chapter, at which there were five thousand brothers, it was revealed to Saint Francis how eighteen thousand demons took counsel against his Order, saying: “We cannot overcome these good brothers because God protects them because of their purity and holiness. Rather, let us wait until weak young men in disguise from the nobility are received into the Order or those who have poor health or who are not fervent, and then on the occasion when these feel the need to be greatly respected, we shall attack the brotherhood and induce sensuality and relaxations.”</p>
<p>Et utinam (ait Pisanus) hoc consilium non esset impletum! (I wish that (the Pisan says) this advice had not yet been fulfilled!)</p>
<p>Saint Francis used to say that the Lord had revealed to him that three generations of people would ruin the purity and simplicity of the Order as much as they could: people of noble birth, young people, and scholars.</p>
<p>Brother Angelo used to say that Saint Francis had a low opinion of his brothers because they lacked the spirit of prayer and devotion, which is the foundation of the spiritual edifice. They do not speak of God but of the world, they construct immoderate buildings which displease God, and they lack charity. Look in the Book of Conformities under the heading Francis the legislator, where you will find harsh words spoken about many evil brothers.</p>
<p>I have said these things because you asked me whether the usual way of life within the “family” is safe in modern times, and because you said that the reason for your doubting was the general blatant relaxations. Therefore, I say to you that what caused you to be doubtful and fearful motivated (even constrained) me to take action, for from time to time relaxations occurred, all of which had been foreseen by Saint Francis when he wrote in the Rule that when the brothers in any place came to realize that they could not observe the Rule spiritually, they should have recourse to the Ministers (in Chapter Ten). With the help of God, the good brothers have always got together and helped one another. It became necessary to do the same at present.</p>
<p>As I promised you, I shall explain my mind regarding the fourth doubt, but note:</p>
<p>With regard to the fourth doubt concerning the factions. Although our Rule is perfect and inspired by the Holy Spirit, there have always been a diversity of factions within the Order and many novelties and many good and bad brothers. This shows the human propensity towards evil but also the envy of the devils, who, seeing the fruit that the Church derives from the Order, asked God to allow them to destroy it. Although such permission was not given, nevertheless they have always tried to cause it the utmost disturbance and obstruction. Look in the book called Memoriale Ordinis, where you will find that the Order began to fluctuate and take up novelties from the very beginning.</p>
<p>The most kind Lord, having been moved by the prayers of Saint Francis, has never abandoned this Order but has always sent good brothers who were really zealous for the Rule and perfect observance. He promised this to Saint Francis when the Saint was disturbed by scandals among the brothers, saying to him: “Why are you disturbed by the scandals among the brothers? I planted this Order and I will preserve it, and there will always be brothers who are truly observant, and I will have them born.” Look in the Conformities, fruit IX. The Lord concluded by saying: “If there were only three observant brothers in the Order, I would not abandon them, and it will always be My Order.”</p>
<p>As far as this matter is concerned, I say that the reason for so many divisions was that from time to time there were many good and holy brothers who were really zealous and observers of the Rule. When they saw transgressions and relaxations, they sought to remedy them. Within the community (with great difficulty, however, because of the many impediments and opposition), there were those who observed the Rule as best they could. Others, in order to be more expedient and wishing to assist one another, sought comfort, demanding special positions within the community and outside it, either at court or in some way or other, so that at different times and in various Provinces, many groups were formed, and reforms begun. Although these were well-intentioned, nonetheless, they failed bit by bit, and nothing was achieved concerning these things, including what was achieved at the time of Saint Bernadine and his companions.</p>
