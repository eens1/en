<p>Text: <em>Let the brothers who are the ministers and servants of the others visit and admonish their brothers and humbly and charitably correct them, not commanding them anything that is against their soul and our Rule</em>. […]</p>
<p>Scrupulous Brother. – Should a brother who wishes to live without danger accept being Minister?</p>
<p>Mature Brother. – I say that as far as he can he should avoid that office and other offices. When he sees that he cannot exercise it with proper diligence because either he cannot correct abuses and relaxations or correct the imperfect multitude or for any other reason, he should not accept it under any circumstances.</p>
<p>Likewise, this is true just as much when he knows that he is incapable or unworthy and this is so as well as when he seeks office directly or indirectly and exercises that office to the detriment of his soul. One cannot count how many evils are due to ambition. Can. Multi, 40 distinction reads: Quicumque desideravit primatum in terra, inveniet confusionem in coelo; nec inter servos Christi computabitur, qui de primate tractaverit.</p>
<p>If he is forced to accept office, let him exercise it with great fear of God and zeal for religion, always working towards reform as far as he can so that the Rule and ordinances are observed, especially things pertaining to divine worship and honor, work, prayer, charity towards the sick, and the preservation and support of regular observance.</p>
<p>Let him visit the brothers with concern, charity, and humility, extending every courtesy to them: Praelatus debet erga subditos sollicitam curam gerere, admonish them kindly, lest si inordinatum silentium culpa non esset, nequaquam Propheta diceret: Vae mihi quia tacui.</p>
<p>Let him correct them with discretion and charity as it says in the Rule and not out of an appetite for revenge: Praelatus non debet ex vindicta corrigere subditos, and impose a penance with mercy, since tutius redditur ratio de misericordia quam de crudelitate.
Let him not be precipitant nor believe easily, but before going ahead let him examine the case carefully and discover the truth: Praelatus non debet de subditis facile credere.</p>
<p>Let him be observant, scrupulous, devout, humble, poor in food and clothing, and exemplary in all his conduct, being on guard against giving bad example as if it were death: Praelatus mali tot mortibus digni sunt, quot ad subditos suos perditionis exempla transmittunt. Praelatus malus suo exemplo multos secum trahit ad inferos. Vita pastoris debet esse exemplar subditis.</p>
<p>He should go ahead of all others in things that are good: Praelatus debet in conversatione et sermone praeire.
He should correct delinquents and not allow transgressions, since peccata subditorum prelatis imputantur.</p>
<p>I say the same with regard to the guardian who fears God and wishes to save himself. In addition to what has been said, let him study the Rule and its explanations and the ordinances and have them observed, especially with respect to money. Let him have the ordinances read continually and have them explained and, at an appointed time, consult with the brothers, always exhorting them to observe them and to be reasonably scrupulous, especially with respect to poverty.</p>
<p>Let him provide most scrupulously for the life and clothing of the brothers according to the declarations mentioned above. Let him be solicitous for godly matters, prayer, the office, silence, etc., and charity towards the sick and visitors. Let him keep the brothers in the house, not giving them permission to go out for every reason, not allowing arguments which are the cause of so much evil. Let him have them observe the divine precepts, not having them occupied in servile work on the holy days of obligation. Let him have control of their lifestyle, not allowing recreations or discussions, always promoting good by word and example. In a word, let him not exercise his office causing misfortune and damage to regular observance and the damnation of his soul.</p>
<p>It is the truth and proven by long experience that if the superiors did what they should do, there would be no need to seek further reform. However, because they are negligent and faint-hearted, not concerned about observance, they are the first transgressors and so do not dare to admonish and punish offenders. Thus, they are the strongest cause of all evil and also of all breach of order that comes about through their fault. They damage religious life, and when they die they will have to render a very strict account to God.</p>
<p>Text: Let the brothers who are subject, remember that, for God’s sake, they have renounced their own wills. (This is an admonition). Therefore, I strictly command them to obey their ministers. (This is a precept). According to the Pisan, this includes all superiors because masters are called ministers in the Gospel, in all those things that they have promised the Lord to observe.</p>
<p>Mature Brother. – Note that when the Rule says that the brothers are obliged to obey in all those matters which they have promised to observe, it means that they should obey in all the things that they are commanded to obey as long as they are not against their soul or the Rule. Thus, they renounce their own wills at profession and submit themselves to the will of others. Abandonment of one’s will is the foundation of obedience, and so it says: “Let them remember that for the love of God they have renounced their own wills.” Although the Saint admonishes them to remember this renunciation, by reason of profession its observance had the force of a precept through the declarations of the fathers of the Order.</p>
<p>See above in the first chapter, where living in obedience is mentioned.</p>
