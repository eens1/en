<article>
<p>670 Text: Wherever the brothers may be who know and feel they cannot observe the Rule spiritually, they can and should have recourse to their ministers.</p>
<p>Mature Brother – Note that when it says “they should” [124v], it commands those who cannot observe the Rule spiritually to have recourse to their ministers. When it says “they can,” it means that they are not to be obstructed and thus it commands the other brothers not to impede them.</p>
<p>Scrupulous Brother – The Four Masters, Brother Hugh, Saint Bonaventure, and the Pisan say that to observe the Rule spiritually is to observe it in its purity and rigour, or without the proximate occasion of sin. On the other hand, not being able to observe it spiritually would mean not being able to observe it in its rigour and purity or without going into the occasion of sin against the purity of the Rule, especially in spiritual matters, such as peace of heart and purity of conscience. This is what Saint Bonaventure says.</p>
<p>In the explanation by the Fathers of the Order it says: “To observe the Rule spiritually, that is according to its true meaning, which the Holy Spirit expresses in it at the level of its perfection.”</p>
<p>671 Saint Francis said: “Something is carried out spiritually that is performed simply and in a religious manner, following the spirit not the flesh.” However, there are some who observe it physically but not spiritually, when, imbued with a false spirit, they despise the environment within the Order and the things which other brothers observe spiritually, and always criticise those who are good, without considering that they are living according to the Rule.</p>
<p>Therefore, where they observe that obedience, poverty, chastity, charity, or other essential points of the Rule are in danger, they should have recourse to their ministers. This is what Martin V says: “When property is added to the place, the care of souls, or because of shortages there is need to exceed the usual practice of the Order in questing and dishonest hoarding [125r] against the purity of the Rule, or where there are dishonest friendships, which the brothers cannot abide, especially those who are simple and weak, and similar things.” At the end of chapter two, Saint Bernard says the same thing.</p>
<p>Ubertino and the Serena conscientiae say: “When the brothers are impeded from wearing plain clothing and living austerely, as the Rule commands, or if the places have annual rents or quest for money or items that are inordinate or prohibited, or where there is the danger of annoying friendships which do not foster the Rule and obstruct others; the Rule says that in these and similar circumstances, they not only ‘can’ but ‘must’ have recourse to their superiors and demand that places be set up where the Rule can be observed spiritually and where there are no such impediments. Otherwise, they are blameworthy and despise their own salvation by not manifesting the danger to their soul to their superior. The Rule states ‘where the brothers know’—that is by experience—‘and are aware’—that is through balanced judgement. This is what Saint Bonaventure says.</p>
<p>672 Text: Let the ministers, moreover, receive them charitably and kindly and have such familiarity with them that these same brothers may speak and deal with them as masters with their servants, for so it must be that the ministers are the servants of all the brothers.</p>
<p>Some commentators on the Rule say that it is a precept for the ministers to provide for the brothers who ask for the above-mentioned places. Trust that is based on charity is wonderful, when a subject can say this to his superior and behave as a master would towards his servant.</p>
<p>However, as Saint Bonaventure says, in this situation superiors should not say [125r] an overbearing word to their subjects and surrender all acts of superiority after the example of Him who said “Let he who is greater among you be your servant.” This is what Saint Bonaventure says. Superiors are servants for love of Him who, although He was God, took on the appearance of a servant for us. The Rule does not demand more, nor does it mean anything else but that superiors be the servants of their subjects, and so it says: Non ita debet esse etc. In this regard, subjects may force superiors and remove them when they do the opposite, since they must serve in respect to regular observance. Ex declarationibus Patrum. See the first chapter.</p>
<p>673 Note that Pope Honorius, reviewing very carefully what was in the Rule, said to Saint Francis: Blessed is he etc. See the first chapter.</p>
<p>However, note these words, namely: Wherever the brothers may be who know that they cannot observe the Rule spiritually, they can and should have recourse to their ministers, and the ministers are bound by obedience to grant the brothers what they ask with kindness and freely. If they do not want to do this, the brothers are permitted and have an obedience to observe the Rule to the letter where they can, since both superiors and subjects are subject to the Rule. The Pope said that the words quoted above could be a cause of peril for brothers who are not well founded in the love of virtue and could occasion division and scandal within the Order. Because of this, he wanted to change the words.</p>
<p>Saint Francis replied: “I did not put those words in the Rule, Jesus Christ did, who knows best what is required for the salvation [126r] of the brothers and the good preservation of the religious milieu, and everything that is in the Church and the Order in the future is present and clear to Him. Therefore, Christ’s words should not and cannot be changed. The time will come when the ministers and other superiors will inflict many bitter tribulations on those who wish to observe the Rule spiritually, and just as it is His will and it is obedience to Christ that this life and Rule, which is His, should be understood and observed according to the letter, so it is His will that the above words be placed in the Rule and observed.”</p>
<p>674 Then the Pope said: “He who inspired you to write those words inspired me to change them. However, I will see to it that, preserving the true meaning of the Rule, I will mitigate the literal meaning of the words so that the ministers will know that they are obliged to do as Christ and the Rule wish purely, simply, and there will be no chance of anyone sinning under the pretext of wanting to observe the Rule.”</p>
<p>Thus, the Pope, not Saint Francis, changed these words and inserted those which appear in the Rule at present. This means that good and zealous brothers have authority over superiors with respect to observance of the Rule, as masters do over their servants. Thus, they can command and force them to assist them to observe the Rule, for it states: Possint eis dicere et facere etc. Here great freedom is given to good brothers to put into practice their desire to observe the Rule. These facts are quoted from the chronicles [126v] of the Order where they are related by Brother Leo, the companion of Saint Francis.</p>
<p>675 Note that when Saint Francis was at the Portiuncula, Lord Nicholas of Todi told him with great reverence: “I have resolved to observe the Gospel and the Rule, as I have promised, simply and faithfully, according to the interpretation which Christ dictated through you with the help of His grace. However, I ask a favour of you, that if in my days the brothers fall away from the pure observance of the Rule, as you proclaimed it through the Holy Spirit, with your obedience I, either alone or with some of those who wish to observe it purely, can separate from those who do not wish to observe it and observe it perfectly.” Understanding this, Saint Francis was very happy and blessed him, saying: “Know that what you asked of Christ and of me is granted.” Placing his right hand on that brother, he said: “Tu es sacerdos in aeternam secundum ordinem Melchisedech.” He added that all the promises made by Christ to him would be fulfilled with joy in all those who strove to observe the Rule to the letter without gloss and simply. Laus Deo. Haec ex supredictis chronicis Ordinis.</p>
