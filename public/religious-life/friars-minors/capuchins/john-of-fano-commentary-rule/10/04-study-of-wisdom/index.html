<p>676 Text: Let those who are illiterate not be anxious to learn.</p>
<p>Mature Brother – Saint Francis knew how much misfortune and damage would be caused to regular observance by learning and study, through ambition and prestige within the Order and outside it, through the extinguishing of prayer and devotion, through poverty being harmed by purchasing costly and superfluous books and having recourse to money, through riding horses, by the destruction of an observant lifestyle, and countless evils, which we have experienced in days gone by and at present. He wanted the brothers to proceed along the path of simplicity and to avoid the occasion of such evils. Thus, he invoked curses on the first brother who wanted to study at Bologna, a curse he never wished to withdraw, and that wretched brother died in a bad way.</p>
<p>Once, when the Bishop of Ostia, after being persuaded by the brothers, asked the Cardinal to speak to Saint Francis to accept the advice of wise and learned brothers and to follow what was taught in the Rule of Saint Augustine and Saint Benedict, Saint Francis said to the brothers in the presence of the Cardinal: “My Brothers, the Lord called me by the path of simplicity and humility. In truth, He showed this to me and to those who would believe in me. Therefore, I do not wish that you mention [127v] any Rule to me other than the one the Lord gave me, who wished that in this world I should be a rod to confound the foolish wisdom of the world. Thus, I do not wish to lead you by any other wisdom than this. God will confound you through your wisdom and knowledge.” This is from the chronicles of the Order.
