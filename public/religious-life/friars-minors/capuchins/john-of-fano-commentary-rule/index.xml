      <description>Here end the Dialogue of Salvation, which was written a second time by the same person who wrote the first, with many necessary additions, especially regarding things which are essential to the Rule and intention of Saint Francis concerning the most important point. This happened because [129r] in the time that elapsed between when the first Dialogue was written many changes took place over time in our lifestyle. This forced a change of opinion concerning many things that had been written in the first Dialogue which are better explained in this one with greater security and many points that are most necessary for the observance of the Rule have been added.</description>

      <description>Love and mercy towards sinners Mature Brother – […] Ubertino says that there should be great discretion and charity in this matter, since superiors often withhold the authority to absolve reserved sins to such an extent that the wretches do not dare to have recourse to them. Therefore they fall from sin to sin and remain enmeshed for long periods. Often the superiors proceed without discretion, making the offenders known, transferring them or depriving them of office, or threatening them with harsh words which creates serious danger for souls and is prejudicial to the seal of confession.</description>

      <description>The grace and spirituality of work 643 [Text:] The brothers to whom the Lord has given the grace of working shall work faithfully, that is with respect to their neighbour and the work itself, and devotedly that is with respect to God, as Saint Bonaventure says: since every good intention concerning work should be referred to God.&#xA;Scrupulous Brother – What is the aim of this chapter?&#xA;Mature Brother – the Supreme Pontiffs declared that it is not to be understood simply with respect to physical effort since the exhaustion which Saint Francis wishes to be avoided is laziness which manifests itself in many ways within the Order, namely when studying, reading, teaching, preaching, hearing confessions, in works of charity to both the healthy and the sick and the like.</description>

      <description>Whether the environment of the Franciscan Rule is safe for salvation Scrupulous Brother – Even though in the previous Dialogue I was educated about the things that are necessary for the salvation of the brothers, I ask that for my greater satisfaction you tell me whether living by this Rule and profession is safe and whether those who observe it can be certain about their personal salvation.&#xA;Mature Brother – My son, as I told you on the previous occasion, hold fast to the conviction that this way of life and the Rule are very safe and whoever observes it will undoubtedly be saved.</description>

      <description>Jesus Maria. The most clement and kind God created the rational soul to bestow eternal life on it, and as an illustration of this, He placed mankind in an earthly paradise. To show plainly that He had done this, and that He wished to confer holiness on mankind, He gave them all the necessary means to easily achieve this end, among which recently there are religious Orders, and especially the Friars Minor, in which a person is invited to perform all the works that lead to perfection and his final objective with all ease.</description>
