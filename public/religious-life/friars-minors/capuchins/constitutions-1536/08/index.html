<h1>Chapter 8</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>(101) As Christian Prelates, according to the teaching of Christ our humble Lord, should not resemble the princes of the Gentiles, who lord it over their subjects; but on the contrary, the greater burden they bear on their shoulders, the more they ought to humble themselves and to reflect that, whereas, other friars are bound to obey their Prelates, the Prelates themselves should obey all the brethren. The Chapter which elects them lays it upon them by obedience to serve and minister to the friars in all things, especially in their spiritual needs, after the example of Christ Who came to serve and minister to us and to lay down His life for us. We therefore exhort all our Prelates to be the ministers and servants of all their brethren; this they will be, if in accordance with the teaching of our Seraphic father, they administer spirit and life to their subjects by word and example.</p>
<p>(102) In every election the friars shall proceed purely, simply, holily and canonically. Let them endeavour, according to the counsel of Christ, Our gracious Lord, when invited to His marriage feast, to take the lowest place with Him, rather than seek the first place with Lucifer, remembering that the last shall be first and the first last. Let them shun dignities as Christ did, and accept them only when, like Aaron, they are called by God through holy obedience.</p>
<p>(103) With regard to the General Chapter it is ordained that it be held every three years, about the Feast of Pentecost, as this time is most fitting for so important a matter and as is indicated by our Seraphic father. The provincial Chapter shall be held every year on the second or third Friday after Easter.</p>
<p>(104) As a sign of humility and to show sincere detachment from every kind of ambition, the Vicar General in the General Chapter and the Vicar Provincial in the Provincial Chapter shall spontaneously resign their offices and all authority into the hands of the Definitors elected by the Chapter. In proof of their entire resignation they shall place the seals into the hands of the aforesaid Definitors.</p>
<p>(105) Should the Father Vicar General die during his term of office it is ordained that the first Definitor of the last Chapter shall become Commissary General. But should he have died, the second Definitor shall be Commissary, and likewise for the others. And he shall be bound to convoke the Chapter as soon as possible whenever it can be conveniently held, about the Feast of Pentecost, or in September, where it shall have been determined or prove expedient, with the advice of the other Definitors.</p>
<p>(106) In order to provide for a secure and simple method of removing the Vicar General from office if at any time it should appear that he is not qualified, and in accordance with the wish of St Francis expressed in the Rule, the first three Definitors of the preceding Chapter, having probable and sufficient evidence as to the Vicar General’s unfitness, can and must convoke the Friars to a General Chapter when this proves advisable. At this Chapter they shall discuss the question of his removal from, or retention in, office. Should the Vicar General in any way endeavour to prevent the convocation of the Chapter we determine that he shall be ipso facto deprived of office. Should the General Chapter decide that the Vicar General shall not be removed and that the three aforesaid Definitors have caused all this disorder in the Congregation without just cause, they shall be severely punished at the discretion of the Chapter for having proceeded so rashly.</p>
<p>(107) We also ordain that in the election of the Definitors all the vocals of the Chapter shall have a passive vote. In this election the Vicar General in the General Chapter and the Vicar Provincial in the Provincial Chapter shall have only an active vote. It is further ordained that in the General Chapter six Definitors shall be elected of whom not more than two may be from amongst those elected in the preceding Chapter. In the Provincial Chapter four Definitors shall be elected of whom likewise not more than two may be from those elected in the preceding year.</p>
<p>(108) When the three years have expired the Vicar Provincials shall remain free from office for at least one year. But the Father Vicar General may, for just reasons, give them a passive vote.</p>
<p>(109) During the celebration of the General Chapter, continual and fervent prayers shall be offered up by all the Friars of our Congregation, and during the Provincial Chapter by those of the Province. They shall beseech the Divine Clemency to deign to dispose all our affairs according to His good pleasure, to the praise and glory of His Majesty and the welfare of Holy Church.</p>
