<article>
<p>1 These are the mansions of the children of Israel, who went out of Egypt by their troops under the conduct of Moses and Aaron,</p>
<p>2 Which Moses wrote down according to the places of their encamping, which they changed by the commandment of the Lord.</p>
<p>3 Now the children of Israel departed from Ramesses the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month, the day after the phase, with a mighty hand, in the sight of all the Egyptians,</p>
<p>4 Who were burying their firstborn, whom the Lord had slain (upon their gods also he had executed vengeance,)</p>
<p>5 And they camped in Soccoth.</p>
<p>6 And from Soccoth they came into Etham, which is in the uttermost borders of the wilderness.</p>
<p>7 Departing from thence they came over against Phihahiroth, which looketh towards Beelsephon, and they camped before Magdalum.</p>
<p>8 And departing from Phihahiroth, they passed through the midst of the sea into the wilderness: and having marched three days through the desert of Etham, they camped in Mara.</p>
<p>9 And departing from Mara, they came into Elim, where there were twelve fountains of waters, and seventy palm trees: and there they camped.</p>
<p>10 But departing from thence also, they pitched their tents by the Red Sea. And departing from the Red Sea,</p>
<p>11 They camped in the desert of Sin.</p>
<p>12 And they removed from thence, and came to Daphca.</p>
<p>13 And departing from Daphca, they camped in Alus.</p>
<p>14 And departing from Alus, they pitched their tents in Raphidim, where the people wanted water to drink.</p>
<p>15 And departing from Raphidim, they camped in the desert of Sinai.</p>
<p>16 But departing also from the desert of Sinai, they came to the graves of lust.</p>
<p>17 And departing from the graves of lust, they camped in Haseroth.</p>
<p>18 And from Haseroth they came to Rethma.</p>
<p>19 And departing from Rethma, they camped in Remmomphares.</p>
<p>20 And they departed from thence and came to Lebna.</p>
<p>21 Removing from Lebna they camped in Ressa.</p>
<p>22 And departing from Ressa, they came to Ceelatha.</p>
<p>23 And they removed from thence and camped in the mountain Sepher.</p>
<p>24 Departing from the mountain Sepher, they came to Arada,</p>
<p>25 From thence they went and camped in Maceloth.</p>
<p>26 And departing from Maceloth, they came to Thahath.</p>
<p>27 Removing from Thahath they camped in Thare.</p>
<p>28 And they departed from thence, and pitched their tents in Methca.</p>
<p>29 And removing from Methca, they camped in Hesmona.</p>
<p>30 And departing from Hesmona, they came to Moseroth.</p>
<p>31 And removing from Moseroth, they camped in Benejaacan.</p>
<p>32 And departing from Benejaacan, they came to mount Gadgad.</p>
<p>33 From thence they went and camped in Jetebatha.</p>
<p>34 And from Jetebatha they came to Hebrona.</p>
<p>35 And departing from Hebrona, they camped in Asiongaber.</p>
<p>36 They removed from thence and came into the desert of Sin, which is Cades.</p>
<p>37 And departing from Cades, they camped in mount Hor, in the uttermost borders of the land of Edom.</p>
<p>38 And Aaron the priest went up into mount Hor at the commandment of the Lord: and there he died in the fortieth year of the coming forth of the children of Israel out of Egypt, the fifth month, the first day of the month,</p>
<p>39 When he was a hundred and twenty-three years old.</p>
<p>40 And king Arad the Chanaanite, who dwelt towards the south, heard that the children of Israel were come to the land of Chanaan.</p>
<p>41 And they departed from mount Hor, and camped in Salmona.</p>
<p>42 From whence they removed and came to Phunon.</p>
<p>43 And departing from Phunon, they camped in Oboth.</p>
<p>44 And from Oboth they came to Ijeabarim, which is in the borders of the Moabites.</p>
<p>45 And departing from Ijeabarim they pitched their tents in Dibongab.</p>
<p>46 From thence they went and camped in Helmondeblathaim.</p>
<p>47 And departing from Helmondeblathaim, they came to the mountains of Abarim over against Nabo.</p>
<p>48 And departing from the mountains of Abarim, they passed to the plains of Moab, by the Jordan, over against Jericho.</p>
<p>49 And there they camped from Bethsimoth even to Ablesatim in the plains of the Moabites,</p>
<p>50 Where the Lord said to Moses:</p>
<p>51 Command the children of Israel, and say to them: When you shall have passed over the Jordan, entering into the land of Chanaan,</p>
<p>52 Destroy all the inhabitants of that land: Beat down their pillars, and break in pieces their statues, and waste all their high places,</p>
<p>53 Cleansing the land, and dwelling in it. For I have given it you for a possession.</p>
<p>54 And you shall divide it among you by lot. To the more you shall give a larger part, and to the fewer a lesser. To every one as the lot shall fall, so shall the inheritance be given. The possession shall be divided by the tribes and the families.</p>
<p>55 But if you will not kill the inhabitants of the land: they that remain, shall be unto you as nails in your eyes, and spears in your sides, and they shall be your adversaries in the land of your habitation.</p>
<p>56 And whatsoever I had thought to do to them, I will do to you.</p>
