<p>1 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>
<p>2 Speak to the children of Israel and thou shalt say to them: When you shall be come unto the land of your habitation, which I will give you,</p>
<p>3 And shall make an offering to the Lord, for a holocaust, or a victim, paying your vows, or voluntarily offering gifts, or in your solemnities burning a sweet savour unto the Lord, of oxen or of sheep:</p>
<p>4 Whosoever immolateth the victim, shall offer a sacrifice of fine flour, the tenth part of an ephi, tempered with the fourth part of a hin of oil:</p>
<p>5 And he shall give the same measure of wine to pour out in libations for the holocaust or for the victim. For every lamb,</p>
<p>6 And for every ram there shall be a sacrifice of flour of two tenths, which shall be tempered with the third part of a hin of oil:</p>
<p>7 And he shall offer the third part the same measure of wine for the libation, for a sweet savour to the Lord.</p>
<p>8 But when thou offerest a holocaust or sacrifice of oxen, to fulfil thy vow or for victims of peace offerings,</p>
<p>9 Thou shalt give for every ox three tenths of flour tempered with half a hin of oil,</p>
<p>10 And wine for libations of the same measure, for an offering of most sweet savour to the Lord.</p>
<p>11 Thus shalt thou do</p>
<p>12 For every ox and ram and lamb and kid.</p>
<p>13 Both they that are born in the land, and the strangers</p>
<p>14 Shall offer sacrifices after the same rite.</p>
<p>15 There shall be all one law and judgment both for you and for them who are strangers in the land.</p>
<p>16 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>
<p>17 Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them:</p>
<p>18 When you are come into the land which I will give you,</p>
<p>19 And shall eat of the bread of that country, you shall separate firstfruits to the Lord,</p>
<p>20 Of the things you eat. As you separate firstfruits of your barnfloors:</p>
<p>21 So also shall you give firstfruits of your dough to the Lord.</p>
<p>22 And if through ignorance you omit any of these things, which the Lord hath spoken to Moses,</p>
<p>23 And by him hath commanded you from the day that he began to command and thenceforward,</p>
<p>24 And the multitude have forgotten to do it: they shall offer a calf out of the herd, a holocaust for a most sweet savour to the Lord, and the sacrifice and libations thereof, as the ceremonies require, and a buck goat for sin:</p>
<p>25 And the priest shall pray for all the multitude of the children of Israel: and it shall be forgiven them, because they sinned ignorantly, offering notwithstanding a burnt offering to the Lord for themselves and for their sin and their Ignorance:</p>
<p>26 And it shall be forgiven all the people of the children of Israel: and the strangers that sojourn among them: because it is the fault of all the people through ignorance.</p>
<p>27 But if one soul shall sin ignorantly, he shall offer a she goat of a year old for his sin.</p>
<p>28 And the priest shall pray for him, because he sinned ignorantly before the Lord: and he shall obtain his pardon, and it shall be forgiven him.</p>
<p>29 The same law shall be for all that sin by ignorance, whether they be natives or strangers.</p>
<p>30 But the soul that committeth any thing through pride, whether he be born in the land or a stranger (because he hath been rebellious against the Lord) shall be cut off from among his people:</p>
<p>31 For he hath contemned the word of the Lord, and made void his precept: therefore shall he be destroyed, and shall bear his iniquity.</p>
<p>32 And it came to pass, when the children of Israel were in the wilderness, and had found a man gathering sticks on the sabbath day,</p>
<p>33 That they brought him to Moses and Aaron and the whole multitude.</p>
<p>34 And they put him into prison, not knowing what they should do with him.</p>
<p>35 And the Lord said to Moses: Let that man die, let all the multitude stone him without the camp.</p>
<p>36 And when they had brought him out, they stoned him, and he died as the Lord had commanded.</p>
<p>37 The Lord also said to Moses:</p>
<p>38 Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt tell them to make to themselves fringes in the corners of their garments, putting in them ribands of blue:</p>
<p>39 That when they shall see them, they may remember all the commandments of the Lord, and not follow their own thoughts and eyes going astray after divers things,</p>
<p>40 But rather being mindful of the precepts of the Lord, may do them and be holy to their God.</p>
<p>41 I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, that I might be your God.</p>
