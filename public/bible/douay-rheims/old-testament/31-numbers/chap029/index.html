<p>1 The first day also of the seventh month shall be venerable and holy unto you; you shall do no servile work therein, because it is the day of the sounding and of trumpets.</p>
<p>2 And you shall offer a holocaust for a most sweet odour to the Lord, one calf of the herd, one ram and seven lambs of a year old, without blemish.</p>
<p>3 And for their sacrifices, three tenths of flour tempered with oil to every calf, two tenths to a ram,</p>
<p>4 One tenth to a lamb, which in all are seven lambs:</p>
<p>5 And a buck goat for sin, which is offered for the expiation of the people,</p>
<p>6 Besides the holocaust of the first day of the month with the sacrifices thereof, and the perpetual holocaust with the accustomed libations. With the same ceremonies you shall offer a burnt sacrifice for a most sweet odour to the Lord.</p>
<p>7 The tenth day also of this seventh month shall be holy and venerable unto you, and you shall afflict your souls; you shall do no servile work therein.</p>
<p>8 And you shall offer a holocaust to the Lord for a most sweet odour, one calf of the herd, one ram, and seven lambs of a year old, without blemish:</p>
<p>9 And for their sacrifices, three tenths of flour tempered with oil to every calf, two tenths to a ram,</p>
<p>10 The tenth of a tenth to every lamb, which are in all seven lambs:</p>

<p>13 And you shall offer a holocaust for a most sweet odour to the Lord, thirteen calves of the herd, two rams, and fourteen lambs of a year old, without blemish:</p>
<p>14 And for their libations three tenths of flour tempered with oil to every calf, being in all thirteen calves: and two tenths to each ram, being two rams,</p>
<p>15 And the tenth of a tenth to every lamb, being in all fourteen lambs:</p>
<p>16 And a buck goat for sin, besides the perpetual holocaust, and the sacrifice and the libation thereof.</p>
<p>17 On the second day you shall offer twelve calves of the herd, two rams and fourteen lambs of a year old, without blemish:</p>
<p>18 And the sacrifices and the libations for every one, for the calves and for the rams and for the lambs you shall duly celebrate:</p>
<p>19 And a buck goat for a sin offering besides the perpetual holocaust, and the sacrifice and the libation thereof.</p>
<p>20 The third day you shall offer eleven calves, two rams, and fourteen lambs of a year old, without blemish:</p>
<p>21 And the sacrifices and the libations of every one for the calves and for the rams and for the lambs you shall offer according to the rite:</p>
<p>22 And a buck goat for sin, besides the perpetual holocaust, and the sacrifice, and the libation thereof.</p>
<p>23 The fourth day you shall offer ten calves, two rams, and fourteen lambs of a year old, without blemish:</p>
<p>24 And the sacrifices and the libations of every one for the calves and for the rams and for the lambs you shall celebrate in right manner:</p>
<p>25 And a buck goat for sin, besides the perpetual holocaust, and the sacrifice and the libation thereof.</p>
<p>26 The fifth day you shall offer nine calves, two rams, and fourteen lambs of a year old, without blemish:</p>
<p>27 And the sacrifices and the libations of every one for the calves and for the rams and for the lambs you shall celebrate according to the rite:</p>
<p>28 And a buck goat for sin, besides the perpetual holocaust, and the sacrifice and the libation thereof.</p>
<p>29 The sixth day you shall offer eight calves, two rams, and fourteen lambs of a year old, without blemish:</p>
<p>30 And the sacrifices and the libations of every one for the calves and for the rams and for the lambs you shall celebrate according to the rite:</p>
<p>31 And a buck goat for sin, besides the perpetual holocaust, and the sacrifice and the libation thereof.</p>
<p>32 The seventh day you shall offer seven calves and two rams, and fourteen lambs of a year old, without blemish:</p>
<p>33 And the sacrifices and the libations of every one for the calves and for the rams and for the lambs you shall celebrate according to the rite:</p>
<p>34 And a buck goat for sin, besides the perpetual holocaust, and the sacrifice and the libation thereof.</p>
<p>35 On the eighth day, which is most solemn, you shall do no servile work:</p>
<p>36 But you shall offer a holocaust for a most sweet odour to the Lord, one calf, one ram, and seven lambs of a year old, without blemish:</p>
<p>37 And the sacrifices and the libations of every one for the calves and for the rams and for the lambs you shall celebrate according to the rite:</p>
<p>38 And a buck goat for sin, besides the perpetual holocaust, and the sacrifice and the libation thereof.</p>
<p>39 These things shall you offer to the Lord in your solemnities: besides your vows and voluntary oblations for holocaust, for sacrifice, for libation, and for victims of peace offerings.</p>
