<article>
<p>1 Woe to the provoking and redeemed city, the dove.</p>
<p>2 She hath not hearkened to the voice, neither hath she received discipline: she hath not trusted in the Lord, she drew not near to her God.</p>
<p>3 Her princes are in the midst of her as roaring lions: her judges are evening wolves, they left nothing for the morning.</p>
<p>4 Her prophets are senseless, men without faith: her priests have polluted the sanctuary, they have acted unjustly against the law.</p>
<p>5 The just Lord is in the midst thereof, he will not do iniquity: in the morning, in the morning he will bring his judgment to light, and it shall not be hid: but the wicked man hath not known shame.</p>
<p>6 I have destroyed the nations, and their towers are beaten down: I have made their ways desert, so that there is none that passeth by: their cities are desolate, there is not a man remaining, nor any inhabitant.</p>
<p>7 I said: Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive correction: and her dwelling shall not perish, for all things wherein I have visited her: but they rose early, and corrupted all their thoughts.</p>
<p>8 Wherefore expect me, saith the Lord, in the day of my resurrection that is to come, for my judgment is to assemble the Gentiles, and to gather the kingdoms: and to pour upon them my indignation, all my fierce anger: for with the fire of my jealousy shall all the earth be devoured.</p>
<p>9 Because then I will restore to the people a chosen lip, that all may call upon the name of the Lord, and may serve him with one shoulder.</p>
<p>10 From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia, shall my suppliants, the children of my dispersed people, bring me an offering.</p>
<p>11 In that day thou shalt not be ashamed for all thy doings, wherein thou hast transgressed against me for then I will take away out of the midst of thee thy proud boasters, and thou shalt no more be lifted up because of my holy mountain.</p>
<p>12 And I will leave in the midst of thee a poor and needy people: and they shall hope in the name of the Lord.</p>
<p>13 The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies, nor shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth: for they shall feed, and shall lie down, and there shall be none to make them afraid.</p>
<p>14 Give praise, O daughter of Sion: shout, O Israel: be glad, and rejoice with all thy heart, O daughter of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>15 The Lord hath taken away thy judgment, he hath turned away thy enemies: the king of Israel, the Lord, is in the midst of thee, thou shalt fear evil no more.</p>
<p>16 In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem: Fear not: to Sion: Let not thy hands be weakened.</p>
<p>17 The Lord thy God in the midst of thee is mighty, he will save: he will rejoice over thee with gladness, he will be silent in his love, he will be joyful over thee in praise.</p>
<p>18 The triflers that were departed from the law, I will gather together, because they were of thee: that thou mayest no more suffer reproach for them.</p>
<p>19 Behold I will cut off all that have afflicted thee at that time: and I will save her that halteth, and will gather her that was cast out: and I will get them praise, and a name, in all the land where they had been put to confusion.</p>
<p>20 At that time, when I will bring you: and at the time that I will gather you: for I will give you a name, and praise among all the people of the earth, when I shall have brought back your captivity before your eyes, saith the Lord.</p>
