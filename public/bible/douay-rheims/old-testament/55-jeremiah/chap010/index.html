<p>1 Hear ye the word which the Lord hath spoken concerning you, O house of Israel.</p>
<p>2 Thus saith the Lord: Learn not according to the ways of the Gentiles: and be not afraid of the signs of heaven, which the heathens fear:</p>
<p>3 For the laws of the people are vain: for the works of the hand of the workman hath cut a tree out of the forest with an axe.</p>
<p>4 He hath decked it with silver and gold: he hath put it together with nails and hammers, that it may not fall asunder.</p>
<p>5 They are framed after the likeness of a palm tree, and shall not speak: they must be carried to be removed, because they cannot go. Therefore fear them not, for they can neither do evil nor good.</p>
<p>6 There is none like to thee, O Lord: thou art great, and great is thy name in might.</p>
<p>7 Who shall not fear thee, O king of nations? for thine is the glory: among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their kingdoms there is none like unto thee.</p>
<p>8 They shall be all proved together to be senseless and foolish: the doctrine of their vanity is wood.</p>
<p>9 Silver spread into plates is brought from Tharsis, and gold from Ophaz: the work of the artificer, and of the hand of the coppersmith: violet and purple is their clothing: all these things are the work of artificers.</p>
<p>10 But the Lord is the true God: he is the living God, and the everlasting king: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his threatening.</p>
<p>11 Thus then shall you say to them: The gods that have not made heaven and earth, let them perish from the earth, and from among those places that are under heaven.</p>
<p>12 He that maketh the earth by his power, that prepareth the world by his wisdom, and stretcheth out the heavens by his knowledge.</p>
<p>13 At his voice he giveth a multitude of waters in the heaven, and lifteth up the clouds from the ends of the earth: he maketh lightnings for rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures.</p>
<p>14 Every man is become a fool for knowledge, every artist is confounded in his graven idol: for what he hath cast is false, and there is no spirit in them.</p>
<p>15 They are vain things, and a ridiculous work: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.</p>
<p>16 The portion of Jacob is not like these: for it is he who formed all things: and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: the Lord of hosts is his name.</p>
<p>17 Gather up thy shame out of the land, thou that dwellest in a siege.</p>
<p>18 For thus saith he Lord: Behold I will cast away far off the inhabitants of the land at this time: and I will afflict them, so that they may be found.</p>
<p>19 Woe is me for my destruction, my wound is very grievous. But I said: Truly this is my own evil, and I will bear it.</p>
<p>20 My tabernacle is laid waste, all my cords are broken: my children are gone out from me, and they are not: there is none to stretch forth my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.</p>
<p>21 Because the pastors have done foolishly, and have not sought the Lord: therefore have they not understood, and all their flock is scattered.</p>
<p>22 Behold the sound of a noise cometh, a great commotion out of the land of the north: to make the cities of Juda a desert, and a dwelling for dragons.</p>
<p>23 I know, O Lord, that the way of a man is not his: neither is it in a man to walk, and to direct his steps.</p>
<p>24 Correct me, O Lord, but yet with judgment: and not in thy fury, lest thou bring me to nothing.</p>
<p>25 Pour out thy indignation upon the nations that have not known thee, and upon the provinces that have not called upon thy name: because they have eaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have destroyed his glory.</p>
