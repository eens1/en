<article>
<p>1 The burden of the word of the Lord in the land of Hadrach, and of Damascus the rest thereof: for the eye of man, and of all the tribes of Israel is the Lord&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>2 Emath also in the borders thereof, and Tyre, and Sidon: for they have taken to themselves to be exceeding wise.</p>
<p>3 And Tyre hath built herself a strong hold, and heaped together silver as earth, and gold as the mire of the streets.</p>
<p>4 Behold the Lord shall possess her, and shall strike her strength in the sea, and she shall be devoured with fire.</p>
<p>5 Ascalon shall see, and shall fear, and Gaza, and shall be very sorrowful: and Accaron, because her hope is confounded: and the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ascalon shall not be inhabited.</p>
<p>6 And the divider shall sit in Azotus, and I will destroy the pride of the Philistines.</p>
<p>7 And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his abominations from between his teeth: and even he shall be left to our God, and he shall be as a governor in Juda, and Accaron as a Jebusite.</p>
<p>8 And I will encompass my house with them that serve me in war, going and returning, and the oppressor shall no more pass through them: for now I have seen with my eyes.</p>
<p>9 Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Sion, shout for joy, O daughter of Jerusalem: BEHOLD THY KING will come to thee, the just and saviour: he is poor, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt, the foal of an ass.</p>
<p>10 And I will destroy the chariot out of Ephraim, and the horse out of Jerusalem, and the bow for war shall be broken: and he shall speak peace to the Gentiles, and his power shall be from sea to sea, and from the rivers even to the end of the earth.</p>
<p>11 Thou also by the blood of thy testament hast sent forth thy prisoners out of the pit, wherein is no water.</p>
<p>12 Return to the strong hold, ye prisoners of hope, I will render thee double as I declare today.</p>
<p>13 Because I have bent Juda for me as a bow, I have filled Ephraim: and I will raise up thy sons, O Sion, above thy sons, O Greece, and I will make thee as the sword of the mighty.</p>
<p>14 And the Lord God shall be seen over them, and his dart shall go forth as lightning: and the Lord God will sound the trumpet, and go in the whirlwind of the south.</p>
<p>15 The Lord of hosts will protect them: and they shall devour, and subdue with the stones of the sling: and drinking they shall be inebriated as it were with wine, and they shall be filled as bowls, and as the horns of the altar.</p>
<p>16 And the Lord their God will save them in that day, as the flock of his people: for holy stones shall be lifted up over his land.</p>
<p>17 For what is the good thing of him, and what is his beautiful thing, but the corn of the elect, and wine springing forth virgins?</p>
