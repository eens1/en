<h1>Chapter 21</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Then Job answered, and said:</p>
<p>2 Hear, I beseech you, my words, and do penance.</p>
<p>3 Suffer me, and I will speak, and after, if you please, laugh at my words.</p>
<p>4 Is my debate against man, that I should not have just reason to be troubled?</p>
<p>5 Hearken to me and be astonished, and lay your finger on your mouth.</p>
<p>6 As for me, when I remember, I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my flesh.</p>
<p>7 Why then do the wicked live, are they advanced, and strengthened with riches?</p>
<p>8 Their seed continueth before them, a multitude of kinsmen, and of children&rsquo;s children in their sight.</p>
<p>9 Their houses are secure and peaceable, and the rod of God is not upon them.</p>
<p>10 Their cattle have conceived, and failed not: their cow has calved, and is not deprived of her fruit.</p>
<p>11 Their little ones go out like a flock, and their children dance and play.</p>
<p>12 They take the timbrel, and the harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ.</p>
<p>13 They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment they go down to hell.</p>
<p>14 Who have said to God: Depart from us, we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.</p>
<p>15 Who is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what doth it profit us if we pray to him?</p>
<p>16 Yet because their good things are not in their hand, may the counsel of the wicked be far from me.</p>
<p>17 How often shall the lamp of the wicked be put out, and a deluge come upon them, and he shall distribute the sorrows of his wrath?</p>
<p>18 They shall be as chaff before the face of the wind, and as ashes which the whirlwind scattereth.</p>
<p>19 God shall lay up the sorrow of the father for his children: and when he shall repay, then shall he know.</p>
<p>20 His eyes shall see his own destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty.</p>
<p>21 For what is it to him what befalleth his house after him: and if the number of his months be diminished by one half?</p>
<p>22 Shall any one teach God knowledge, who judgeth those that are high?</p>
<p>23 One man dieth strong, and hale, rich and happy.</p>
<p>24 His bowels are full of fat, and his bones are moistened with marrow.</p>
<p>25 But another dieth in bitterness of soul without any riches:</p>
<p>26 And yet they shall sleep together in the dust, and worms shall cover them.</p>
<p>27 Surely I know your thoughts, and your unjust judgments against me.</p>
<p>28 For you say: Where is the house of the prince? and where are the dwelling places of the wicked?</p>
<p>29 Ask any one of them that go by the way, and you shall perceive that he knoweth these same things.</p>
<p>30 Because the wicked man is reserved to the day of destruction, and he shall be brought to the day of wrath.</p>
<p>31 Who shall reprove his way to his face? and who shall repay him what he hath done?</p>
<p>32 He shall be brought to the graves, and shall watch in the heap of the dead.</p>
<p>33 He hath been acceptable to the gravel of Cocytus, and he shall draw every man after him, and there are innumerable before him.</p>
<p>34 How then do ye comfort me in vain, whereas your answer is shewn to be repugnant to truth?</p>
