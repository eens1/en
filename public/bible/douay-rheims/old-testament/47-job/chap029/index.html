<p>1 Job also added, taking up his parable, and said:</p>
<p>2 Who will grant me, that I might be according to the months past, according to the days in which God kept me?</p>
<p>3 When his lamp shined over my head, and I walked by his light in darkness?</p>
<p>4 As I was in the days of my youth, when God was secretly in my tabernacle?</p>
<p>5 When the Almighty was with me: and my servants round about me?</p>
<p>6 When I washed my feet with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil?</p>
<p>7 When I went out to the gate of the city, and in the street they prepared me a chair?</p>
<p>8 The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the old men rose up and stood.</p>
<p>9 The princes ceased to speak, and laid the finger on their mouth.</p>
<p>10 The rulers held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to their throat.</p>
<p>11 The ear that heard me blessed me, and the eye that saw me gave witness to me:</p>
<p>12 Because I had delivered the poor man that cried out; and the fatherless, that had no helper.</p>
<p>13 The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me, and I comforted the heart of the widow.</p>
<p>14 I was clad with justice: and I clothed myself with my judgment, as with a robe and a diadem.</p>
<p>15 I was an eye to the blind, and a foot to the lame.</p>
<p>16 I was the father of the poor: and the cause which I knew not, I searched out most diligently.</p>
<p>17 I broke the jaws of the wicked man, and out of his teeth I took away the prey.</p>
<p>18 And I said: I shall die in my nest, and as a palm tree shall multiply my days.</p>
<p>19 My root is opened beside the waters, and dew shall continue in my harvest.</p>
<p>20 My glory shall always be renewed, and my bow in my hand shall be repaired.</p>
<p>21 They that heard me, waited for my sentence, and being attentive held their peace at my counsel.</p>
<p>22 To my words they durst add nothing, and my speech dropped upon them.</p>
<p>23 They waited for me as for rain, and they opened their mouth as for a latter shower.</p>
<p>24 If at any time I laughed on them, they believed not, and the light of my countenance fell not on earth.</p>
<p>25 If I had a mind to go to them, I sat first, and when I sat as a king, with his army standing about him, yet I was a comforter of them that mourned.</p>
