<p>1 Then Job answered, and said:</p>
<p>2 Now also my words are in bitterness, and the hand of my scourge is more grievous than my mourning.</p>
<p>3 Who will grant me that I might know and find him, and come even to his throne?</p>
<p>4 I would set judgment before him, and would fill my mouth with complaints.</p>
<p>5 That I might know the words that he would answer me, and understand what he would say to me.</p>
<p>6 I would not that he should contend with me with much strength, nor overwhelm me with the weight of his greatness.</p>
<p>7 Let him propose equity against me, and let my judgment come to victory.</p>
<p>8 But if I go to the east, he appeareth not; if to the west, I shall not understand him.</p>
<p>9 If to the left hand, what shall I do? I shall not take hold on him: if I turn myself to the right hand, I shall not see him.</p>
<p>10 But he knoweth my way, and has tried me as gold that passeth through the fire:</p>
<p>11 My foot hath followed his steps, I have kept his way, and have not declined from it.</p>
<p>12 I have not departed from the commandments of his lips, and the words of his mouth I have hid in my bosom.</p>
<p>13 For he is alone, and no man can turn away his thought: and whatsoever his soul hath desired, that hath he done.</p>
<p>14 And when he shall have fulfilled his will in me, many other like things are also at hand with him.</p>
<p>15 And therefore I am troubled at his presence, and when I consider him, I am made pensive with fear.</p>
<p>16 God hath softened my heart, and the Almighty hath troubled me.</p>
<p>17 For I have not perished because of the darkness that hangs over me, neither hath the mist covered my face.</p>
