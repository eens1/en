<p>1 At this my heart trembleth, and is moved out of its place.</p>
<p>2 Hear ye attentively the terror of his voice, and the sound that cometh out of his mouth.</p>
<p>3 He beholdeth under all the heavens, and his light is upon the ends of the earth.</p>
<p>4 After it a noise shall roar, he shall thunder with the voice of his majesty, and shall not be found out, when his voice shall be heard.</p>
<p>5 God shall thunder wonderfully with his voice, he that doth great and unsearchable things.</p>
<p>6 He commandeth the snow to go down upon the earth, and the winter rain, and the shower of his strength.</p>
<p>7 He sealeth up the hand of all men, that every one may know his works.</p>
<p>8 Then the beast shall go into his covert, and shall abide in his den.</p>
<p>9 Out of the inner parts shall a tempest come, and cold out of the north.</p>
<p>10 When God bloweth there cometh frost, and again the waters are poured out abundantly.</p>
<p>11 Corn desireth clouds, and the clouds spread their light:</p>
<p>12 Which go round about, whithersoever the will of him that governeth them shall lead them, to whatsoever he shall command them upon the face of the whole earth:</p>
<p>13 Whether in one tribe, or in his own land, or in what place soever of his mercy he shall command them to be found.</p>
<p>14 Hearken to these things, Job: Stand, and consider the wondrous works of God.</p>
<p>15 Dost thou know when God commanded the rains, to shew his light of his clouds?</p>
<p>16 Knowest thou the great paths of the clouds, and the perfect knowledges?</p>
<p>17 Are not thy garments hot, when the south wind blows upon the earth?</p>
<p>18 Thou perhaps hast made the heavens with him, which are most strong, as if they were of molten brass.</p>
<p>19 Shew us what we may say to him: or we are wrapped up in darkness.</p>
<p>20 Who shall tell him the things I speak? even if a man shall speak, he shall be swallowed up.</p>
<p>21 But now they see not the light: the air on a sudden shall be thickened into clouds, and the wind shall pass and drive them away.</p>
<p>22 Cold cometh out of the north, and to God praise with fear.</p>
<p>23 We cannot find him worthily: he is great in strength, and in judgment, and in justice, and he is ineffable.</p>
<p>24 Therefore men shall fear him, and all that seem to themselves to be wise, shall not dare to behold him.</p>
