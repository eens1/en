<p>1 Then Baldad the Suhite answered, and said:</p>
<p>2 How long will you throw out words? understand first, and so let us speak.</p>
<p>3 Why are we reputed as beasts, and counted vile before you?</p>
<p>4 Thou that destroyest thy soul in thy fury, shall the earth be forsaken for thee, and shall rocks be removed out of their place?</p>
<p>5 Shall not the light of the wicked be extinguished, and the flame of his fire not shine?</p>
<p>6 The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and the lamp that is over him, shall be put out.</p>
<p>7 The step of his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall cast him down headlong.</p>
<p>8 For he hath thrust his feet into a net, and walketh in its meshes.</p>
<p>9 The sole of his foot shall be held in a snare, and thirst shall burn against him.</p>
<p>10 A gin is hidden for him in the earth, and his trap upon the path.</p>
<p>11 Fears shall terrify him on every side, and shall entangle his feet.</p>
<p>12 Let his strength be wasted with famine, and let hunger invade his ribs.</p>
<p>13 Let it devour the beauty of his skin, let the firstborn death consume his arms.</p>
<p>14 Let his confidence be rooted out of his tabernacle, and let destruction tread upon him like a king.</p>
<p>15 Let the companions of him that is not, dwell in his tabernacle, let brimstone be sprinkled in his tent.</p>
<p>16 Let his roots be dried up beneath, and his harvest destroyed above.</p>
<p>17 Let the memory of him perish from the earth, and let not his name be renowned in the streets.</p>
<p>18 He shall drive him out of light into darkness, and shall remove him out of the world.</p>
<p>19 His seed shall not subsist, nor his offspring among his people, nor any remnants in his country.</p>
<p>20 They that come after him shall be astonished at his day, and horror shall fall upon them that went before.</p>
<p>21 These then are the tabernacles of the wicked, and this the place of him that knoweth not God.</p>
