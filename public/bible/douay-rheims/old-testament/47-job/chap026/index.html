<h1>Chapter 26</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Then Job answered, and said:</p>
<p>2 Whose helper art thou? is it of him that is weak? and dost thou hold up the arm of him that has no strength?</p>
<p>3 To whom hast thou given counsel? perhaps to him that hath no wisdom, and thou hast shewn thy very great prudence.</p>
<p>4 Whom hast thou desired to teach? was it not him that made life?</p>
<p>5 Behold the giants groan under the waters, and they that dwell with them.</p>
<p>6 Hell is naked before him, and there is no covering for destruction.</p>
<p>7 He stretched out the north over the empty space, and hangeth the earth upon nothing.</p>
<p>8 He bindeth up the waters in his clouds, so that they break not out and fall down together.</p>
<p>9 He withholdeth the face of his throne, and spreadeth his cloud over it.</p>
<p>10 He hath set bounds about the waters, till light and darkness come to an end.</p>
<p>11 The pillars of heaven tremble, and dread at his beck.</p>
<p>12 By his power the seas are suddenly gathered together, and his wisdom has struck the proud one.</p>
<p>13 His spirit hath adorned the heavens, and his obstetric hand brought forth the winding serpent.</p>
<p>14 Lo, these things are said in part of his ways: and seeing we have heard scarce a little drop of his word, who shall be able to behold the thunder of his greatness?</p>
