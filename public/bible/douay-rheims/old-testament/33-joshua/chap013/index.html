<h1>Chapter 13</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Joshua was old, and far advanced in years, and the Lord said to him: Thou art grown old, and advanced in age, and there is a very large country left, which is not yet divided by lot:</p>
<p>2 To wit, all Galilee, Philistia, and all Gessuri.</p>
<p>3 From the troubled river, that watereth Egypt, unto the border of Accaron northward: the land of Chanaan, which is divided among the lords of the Philistines, the Gazites, the Azotians, the Ascalonites, the Gethites, and the Accronites.</p>
<p>4 And on the south side are the Hevites, all the land of Chanaan, and Maara of the Sidonians as far as Apheca, and the borders of the Amorrhite,</p>
<p>5 And his confines. The country also of Libanus towards the east from Baalgad under mount Hermon to the entering into Emath.</p>
<p>6 Of all that dwell in the mountains from Libanus, to the waters of Maserephoth, and all the Sidonians. I am he that will cut them off from before the face of the children of Israel. So let their land come in as a part of the inheritance of Israel, as I have commanded thee.</p>
<p>7 And now divide the land in possession to the nine tribes, and to the half tribe of Manasses,</p>
<p>8 With whom Ruben and Gad have possessed the land, which Moses the servant of the Lord delivered to them beyond the river Jordan, on the east side.</p>
<p>9 From Aroer, which is upon the bank of the torrent Arnon, and in the midst of the valley and all the plains of Medaba, as far as Dibon:</p>
<p>10 And all the cities of Sehon, king of the Amorrhites, who reigned in Hesebon, unto the borders of the children of Ammon.</p>
<p>11 And Galaad, and the borders of Gessuri and Machati, and all mount Hermon, and all Basan as far as Salecha,</p>
<p>12 All the kingdom of Og in Basan, who reigned in Astaroth and Edrai, he was of the remains of the Raphaims: and Moses overthrew and destroyed them.</p>
<p>13 And the children of Israel would not destroy Gessuri and Machati and they have dwelt in the midst of Israel, until this present day.</p>
<p>14 But to the tribe of Levi he gave no possession: but the sacrifices and victims of thee Lord God of Israel, are his inheritance, as he spoke to him.</p>
<p>15 And Moses gave a possession to the children of Ruben according to their kindreds.</p>
<p>16 And their border was from Aroer, which is on the bank of the torrent Arnon, and in the midst of the valley of the same torrent: all the plain, that leadeth to Medaba,</p>
<p>17 And Hesebon, and all their villages, which are in the plains. Dibon also, and Bamothbaal, and the town of Baalmaon,</p>
<p>18 And Jassa, and Cidimoth, and Mephaath,</p>
<p>19 And Cariathaim, and Sabama, and Sarathasar in the mountain of the valley.</p>
<p>20 Bethphogor and Asedoth, Phasga and Bethiesimoth,</p>
<p>21 And all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdoms of Sehon king of the Amorrhites, that reigned in Hesebon, whom Moses slew with the princes of Madian: Hevi, and Recem, and Sur and Hur, and Rebe, dukes of Sehon inhabitants of the land.</p>
<p>22 Balaam also the son of Beor the soothsayer, the children of Israel slew with the sword among the rest that were slain.</p>
<p>23 And the river Jordan was the border of the children of Ruben. This is the possession of the Rubenites, by their kindreds, of cities and villages.</p>
<p>24 And Moses gave to the tribe of Gad and to his children by their kindreds a possession, of which this is the division.</p>
<p>25 The border of Jaser, and all the cities of Galaad, and half the land of the children of Ammon: as far as Aroer which is over against Rabba:</p>
<p>26 And from Hesebon unto Ramoth, Masphe and Betonim: and from Manaim unto the borders of Dabir.</p>
<p>27 And in the valley Betharan and Bethnemra, and Socoth, and Saphon the other part of the kingdom of Sehon king of Hesebon: the limit of this also is the Jordan, as far as the uttermost part of the sea of Cenereth beyond the Jordan on the east side,</p>
<p>28 This is the possession of the children of Gad by their families, their cities, and villages.</p>
<p>29 He gave also to the half tribe of Manasses and his children possession according to their kindreds,</p>
<p>30 The beginning whereof is this: from Manaim all Basan, and all the kingdoms of Og king of Basan, and all the villages of Jair, which are in Basan, threescore towns.</p>
<p>31 And half Galaad, and Astaroth, and Edrai, cities of the kingdom of Og in Basan: to the children of Machir, the son of Manasses, to one half of the children of Machir according to their kindreds.</p>
<p>32 This possession Moses divided in the plains of Moab, beyond the Jordan, over against Jericho on the east side,</p>
<p>33 But to the tribe of Levi he gave no possession: because the Lord the God of Israel himself is their possession, as he spoke to them.</p>
