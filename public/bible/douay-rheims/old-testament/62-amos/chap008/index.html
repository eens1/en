<h1>Chapter 8</h1>

<div class="content">

<p>1 These things the Lord shewed to me: and behold a hook to draw down the fruit.</p>
<p>2 And he said: What seest thou, Amos? And I said: A hook to draw down fruit. And the Lord said to me: The end is come upon my people Israel: I will not again pass by them any more.</p>
<p>3 And the hinges of the temple shall screak in that day, saith the Lord God: many shall die: silence shall be cast in every place.</p>
<p>4 Hear this, you that crush the poor, and make the needy of the land to fail,</p>
<p>5 Saying: When will the month be over, and we shall sell our wares: and the sabbath, and we shall open the corn: that we may lessen the measure, and increase the sicle, and may convey in deceitful balances,</p>
<p>6 That we may possess the needy for money, and the poor for a pair of shoes, and may sell the refuse of the corn?</p>
<p>7 The Lord hath sworn against the pride of Jacob: surely I will never forget all their works.</p>
<p>8 Shall not the land tremble for this, and every one mourn that dwelleth therein: and rise up altogether as a river, and be cast out, and run down as the river of Egypt?</p>
<p>9 And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord God, that the sun shall go down at midday, and I will make the earth dark in the day of light:</p>
<p>10 And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation: and I will bring up sackcloth upon every back of yours, and baldness upon every head: and I will make it as the mourning of an only son, and the latter end thereof as a bitter day.</p>
<p>11 Behold the days come, saith the Lord, and I will send forth a famine into the land: not a famine of bread, nor a thirst of water, but of hearing the word of the Lord.</p>
<p>12 And they shall move from sea to sea, and from the north to the east: they shall go about seeking the word of the Lord, and shall not find it.</p>
<p>13 In that day the fair virgins, and the young men shall faint for thirst.</p>
<p>14 They that swear by the sin of Samaria, and say: Thy God, O Dan, liveth: and the way of Bersabee liveth: and they shall fall, and shall rise no more.</p>
