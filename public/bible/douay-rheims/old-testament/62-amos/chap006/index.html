<p>1 Woe to you that are wealthy in Sion, and to you that have confidence in the mountain of Samaria: ye great men, heads of the people, that go in with state into the house of Israel.</p>
<p>2 Pass ye over to Chalane, and see, and go from thence into Emath the great: and go down into Geth of the Philistines, and to all the best kingdoms of these: if their border be larger than your border.</p>
<p>3 You that are separated unto the evil day: and that approach to the throne of iniquity;</p>
<p>4 You that sleep upon beds of ivory, and are wanton on your couches: that eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves out of the midst of the herd;</p>
<p>5 You that sing to the sound of the psaltery: they have thought themselves to have instruments of music like David;</p>
<p>6 That drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the best ointments: and they are not concerned for the affliction of Joseph.</p>
<p>7 Wherefore now they shall go captive at the head of them that go into captivity: and the faction of the luxurious ones shall be taken away.</p>
<p>8 The Lord God hath sworn by his own soul, saith the Lord the God of hosts: I detest the pride of Jacob, and I hate his houses, and I will deliver up the city with the inhabitants thereof.</p>
<p>9 And if there remain ten men in one house, they also shall die.</p>
<p>10 And a man&rsquo;s kinsman shall take him up, and shall burn him, that he may carry the bones out of the house; and he shall say to him that is in the inner rooms of the house: Is there yet any with thee?</p>
<p>11 And he shall answer: There is an end. And he shall say to him: Hold thy peace, and mention not the name of the Lord.</p>
<p>12 For behold the Lord hath commanded, and he will strike the greater house with breaches, and the lesser house with clefts.</p>
<p>13 Can horses run upon the rocks, or can any one plough with buffles? for you have turned judgment into bitterness, and the fruit of justice into wormwood.</p>
<p>14 You that rejoice in a thing of nought: you that say: Have we not taken unto us horns by our own strength?</p>
<p>15 But behold, I will raise up a nation against you, O house of Israel, saith the Lord the God of hosts; and they shall destroy you from the entrance of Emath, even to the torrent of the desert.</p>
