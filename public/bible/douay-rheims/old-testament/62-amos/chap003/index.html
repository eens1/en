<h1>Chapter 3</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Hear the word that the Lord hath spoken concerning you, O ye children of Israel: concerning the whole family that I brought up out of the land of Egypt, saying:</p>
<p>2 You only have I known of all the families of the earth: therefore will I visit upon you all your iniquities.</p>
<p>3 Shall two walk together except they be agreed?</p>
<p>4 Will a lion roar in the forest, if he have no prey? will the lion&rsquo;s whelp cry out of his den, if he have taken nothing?</p>
<p>5 Will the bird fall into the snare upon the earth, if there be no fowler? Shall the snare be taken up from the earth, before it hath taken somewhat?</p>
<p>6 Shall the trumpet sound in a city, and the people not be afraid? Shall there be evil in a city, which the Lord hath not done?</p>
<p>7 For the Lord God doth nothing without revealing his secret to his servants the prophets.</p>
<p>8 The lion shall roar, who will not fear? The Lord God hath spoken, who shall not prophesy?</p>
<p>9 Publish it in the houses of Azotus, and in the houses of the land of Egypt, and say: Assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria, and behold the many follies in the midst thereof, and them that suffer oppression in the inner rooms thereof.</p>
<p>10 And they have not known to do the right thing, saith the Lord, storing up iniquity, and robberies in their houses.</p>
<p>11 Therefore thus saith the Lord God: The land shall be in tribulation, and shall be compassed about: and thy strength shall be taken away from thee, and thy houses shall be spoiled.</p>
<p>12 Thus saith the Lord: As if a shepherd should get out of the lion&rsquo;s mouth two legs, or the tip of the ear: so shall the children of Israel be taken out that dwell in Samaria, in a place of a bed, and in the couch of Damascus.</p>
<p>13 Hear ye, and testify in the house of Jacob, saith the Lord the God of hosts:</p>
<p>14 That in the day when I shall begin to visit the transgressions of Israel, I will visit upon him, and upon the altars of Bethel: and the horns of the altars shall be cut off, and shall fall to the ground.</p>
<p>15 And I will strike the winter house with the summer house: and the houses of ivory shall perish, and many houses shall be destroyed, saith the Lord.</p>
