<p>1 Hear ye this word, which I take up concerning you for a lamentation. The house of Israel is fallen, and it shall rise no more.</p>
<p>2 The virgin of Israel is cast down upon her land, there is none to raise her up.</p>
<p>3 For thus saith the Lord God: The city, out of which came forth a thousand, there shall be left in it a hundred: and out of which there came a hundred, there shall be left in it ten, in the house of Israel.</p>
<p>4 For thus saith the Lord to the house of Israel: Seek ye me, and you shall live.</p>
<p>5 But seek not Bethel, and go not into Galgal, neither shall you pass over to Bersabee: for Galgal shall go into captivity, and Bethel shall be unprofitable.</p>
<p>6 Seek ye the Lord, and live: lest the house of Joseph be burnt with fire, and it shall devour, and there shall be none to quench Bethel.</p>
<p>7 You that turn judgment into wormwood, and forsake justice in the land,</p>
<p>8 Seek him that maketh Arcturus, and Orion, and that turneth darkness into morning, and that changeth day into night: that calleth the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The Lord is his name.</p>
<p>9 He that with a smile bringeth destruction upon the strong, and waste upon the mighty.</p>
<p>10 They have hated him that rebuketh in the gate: and have abhorred him that speaketh perfectly.</p>
<p>11 Therefore because you robbed the poor, and took the choice prey from him: you shall build houses with square stone, and shall not dwell in them: you shall plant most delightful vineyards, and shall not drink the wine of them.</p>
<p>12 Because I know your manifold crimes, and your grievous sins: enemies of the just, taking bribes, and oppressing the poor in the gate.</p>
<p>13 Therefore the prudent shall keep silence at that time, for it is an evil time.</p>
<p>14 Seek ye good, and not evil, that you may live: and the Lord the God of hosts will be with you, as you have said.</p>
<p>15 Hate evil, and love good, and establish judgment in the gate: it may be the Lord the God of hosts may have mercy on the remnant of Joseph.</p>
<p>16 Therefore thus saith the Lord the God of hosts the sovereign Lord: In every street there shall be wailing: and in all places that are without, they shall say: Alas, alas! and they shall call the husbandman to mourning, and such as are skilful in lamentation to lament.</p>
<p>17 And in all vineyards there shall be wailing: because I will pass through in the midst of thee, saith the Lord.</p>
<p>18 Woe to them that desire the day of the Lord: to what end is it for you? the day of the Lord is darkness, and not light.</p>
<p>19 As if a man should flee from the face of a lion, and a bear should meet him: or enter into the house, and lean with his hand upon the wall, and a serpent should bite him.</p>
<p>20 Shall not the day of the Lord be darkness, and not light: and obscurity, and no brightness in it?</p>
<p>21 I hate, and have rejected your festivities: and I will not receive the odour of your assemblies.</p>
<p>22 And if you offer me holocausts, and your gifts, I will not receive them: neither will I regard the vows of your fat beasts.</p>
<p>23 Take away from me the tumult of thy songs: and I will not hear the canticles of thy harp.</p>
<p>24 But judgment shall be revealed as water, and justice as a mighty torrent.</p>
<p>25 Did you offer victims and sacrifices to me in the desert for forty years, O house of Israel?</p>
<p>26But you carried a tabernacle for your Moloch, and the image of your idols, the star of your god, which you made to yourselves.</p>
<p>27 And I will cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, saith the Lord, the God of hosts is his name.</p>
