<article>
<p>1 Give glory to the Lord, and call upon his name: declare his deeds among the Gentiles.</p>
<p>2 Sing to him, yea sing praises to him: relate all his wondrous works.</p>
<p>3 Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the Lord.</p>
<p>4 Seek ye the Lord, and be strengthened: seek his face evermore.</p>
<p>5 Remember his marvellous works which he hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth.</p>
<p>6 O ye seed of Abraham his servant; ye sons of Jacob his chosen.</p>
<p>7 He is the Lord our God: his judgments are in all the earth.</p>
<p>8 He hath remembered his covenant for ever: the word which he commanded to a thousand generations.</p>
<p>9 Which he made to Abraham; and his oath to Isaac:</p>
<p>10 And he appointed the same to Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting testament:</p>
<p>11 Saying: To thee will I give the land of Chanaan, the lot of your inheritance.</p>
<p>12 When they were but a small number: yea very few, and sojourners therein:</p>
<p>13 And they passed from nation to nation, and from one kingdom to another people.</p>
<p>14 He suffered no man to hurt them: and he reproved kings for their sakes.</p>
<p>15 Touch ye not my anointed: and do no evil to my prophets.</p>
<p>16 And he called a famine upon the land: and he broke in pieces all the support of bread.</p>
<p>17 He sent a man before them: Joseph, who was sold for a slave.</p>
<p>18 They humbled his feet in fetters: the iron pierced his soul,</p>
<p>19 Until his word came. The word of the Lord inflamed him.</p>
<p>20 The king sent, and he released him: the ruler of the people, and he set him at liberty.</p>
<p>21 He made him master of his house, and ruler of all his possession.</p>
<p>22 That he might instruct his princes as himself, and teach his ancients wisdom.</p>
<p>23 And Israel went into Egypt: and Jacob was a sojourner in the land of Cham.</p>
<p>24 And he increased his people exceedingly: and strengthened them over their enemies.</p>
<p>25 He turned their heart to hate his people: and to deal deceitfully with his servants.</p>
<p>26 He sent Moses his servant: Aaron the man whom he had chosen.</p>
<p>27 He gave them power to shew them signs, and his wonders in the land of Cham.</p>
<p>28 He sent darkness, and made it obscure: and grieved not his words.</p>
<p>29 He turned their waters into blood, and destroyed their fish.</p>
<p>30 Their land brought forth frogs, in the inner chambers of their kings.</p>
<p>31 He spoke, and there came divers sorts of flies and sciniphs in all their coasts.</p>
<p>32 He gave them hail for rain, a burning fire in the land.</p>
<p>33 And he destroyed their vineyards and their fig trees: and he broke in pieces the trees of their coasts.</p>
<p>34 He spoke, and the locust came, and the bruchus, of which there was no number.</p>
<p>35 And they devoured all the grass in their land, and consumed all the fruit of their ground.</p>
<p>36 And he slew all the firstborn in their land: the firstfruits of all their labour.</p>
<p>37 And he brought them out with silver and gold: and there was not among their tribes one that was feeble.</p>
<p>38 Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them lay upon them.</p>
<p>39 He spread a cloud for their protection, and fire to give them light in the night.</p>
<p>40 They asked, and the quail came: and he filled them with the bread of heaven.</p>
<p>41 He opened the rock, and waters flowed: rivers ran down in the dry land.</p>
<p>42 Because he remembered his holy word, which he had spoken to his servant Abraham.</p>
<p>43 And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with gladness.</p>
<p>44 And he gave them the lands of the Gentiles: and they possessed the labours of the people:</p>
<p>45 That they might observe his justifications, and seek after his law.</p>
