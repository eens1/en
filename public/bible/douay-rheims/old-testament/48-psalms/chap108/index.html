<h1>Chapter 108</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Unto the end, a psalm for David.</p>
<p>2 O God, be not thou silent in my praise: for the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful man is opened against me.</p>
<p>3 They have spoken against me with deceitful tongues; and they have compassed me about with words of hatred; and have fought against me without cause.</p>
<p>4 Instead of making me a return of love, they detracted me: but I gave myself to prayer.</p>
<p>5 And they repaid me evil for good: and hatred for my love.</p>
<p>6 Set thou the sinner over him: and may the devil stand at his right hand.</p>
<p>7 When he is judged, may he go out condemned; and may his prayer be turned to sin.</p>
<p>8 May his days be few: and his bishopric let another take.</p>
<p>9 May his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.</p>
<p>10 Let his children be carried about vagabonds, and beg; and let them be cast out of their dwellings.</p>
<p>11 May the usurer search all his substance: and let strangers plunder his labours.</p>
<p>12 May there be none to help him: nor none to pity his fatherless offspring.</p>
<p>13 May his posterity be cut off; in one generation may his name be blotted out.</p>
<p>14 May the iniquity of his fathers be remembered in the sight of the Lord: and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.</p>
<p>15 May they be before the Lord continually, and let the memory of them perish from the earth:</p>
<p>16 because he remembered not to shew mercy,</p>
<p>17 But persecuted the poor man and the beggar; and the broken in heart, to put him to death.</p>
<p>18 And he loved cursing, and it shall come unto him: and he would not have blessing, and it shall be far from him. And he put on cursing, like a garment: and it went in like water into his entrails, and like oil in his bones.</p>
<p>19 May it be unto him like a garment which covereth him; and like a girdle with which he is girded continually.</p>
<p>20 This is the work of them who detract me before the Lord; and who speak evils against my soul.</p>
<p>21 But thou, O Lord, do with me for thy name&rsquo;s sake: because thy mercy is sweet. Do thou deliver me,</p>
<p>22 For I am poor and needy, and my heart is troubled within me.</p>
<p>23 I am taken away like the shadow when it declineth: and I am shaken off as locusts.</p>
<p>24 My knees are weakened through fasting: and my flesh is changed for oil.</p>
<p>25 And I am become a reproach to them: they saw me and they shaked their heads.</p>
<p>26 Help me, O Lord my God; save me; according to thy mercy.</p>
<p>27 And let them know that this is thy hand: and that thou, O Lord, hast done it.</p>
<p>28 They will curse and thou wilt bless: let them that rise up against me be confounded: but thy servant shall rejoice.</p>
<p>29 Let them that detract me be clothed with shame: and let them be covered with their confusion as with a double cloak.</p>
<p>30 I will give great thanks to the Lord with my mouth: and in the midst of many I will praise him.</p>
<p>31 Because he hath stood at the right hand of the poor, to save my soul from persecutors.</p>
