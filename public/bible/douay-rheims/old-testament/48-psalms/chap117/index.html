<h1>Chapter 117</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Give praise to the Lord, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
<p>2 Let Israel now say, that he is good: that his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
<p>3 Let the house of Aaron now say, that his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
<p>4 Let them that fear the Lord now say, that his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
<p>5 In my trouble I called upon the Lord: and the Lord heard me, and enlarged me.</p>
<p>6 The Lord is my helper: I will not fear what man can do unto me.</p>
<p>7 The Lord is my helper: and I will look over my enemies.</p>
<p>8 It is good to confide in the Lord, rather than to have confidence in man.</p>
<p>9 It is good to trust in the Lord, rather than to trust in princes.</p>
<p>10 All nations compassed me about; and, in the name of the Lord I have been revenged on them.</p>
<p>11 Surrounding me they compassed me about: and in the name of the Lord I have been revenged on them.</p>
<p>12 They surrounded me like bees, and they burned like fire among thorns: and in the name of the Lord I was revenged on them.</p>
<p>13 Being pushed I was overturned that I might fall: but the Lord supported me.</p>
<p>14 The Lord is my strength and my praise: and he is become my salvation.</p>
<p>15 The voice of rejoicing and of salvation is in the tabernacles of the just.</p>
<p>16 The right hand of the Lord hath wrought strength: the right hand of the Lord hath exalted me: the right hand of the Lord hath wrought strength.</p>
<p>17 I shall not die, but live: and shall declare the works of the Lord.</p>
<p>18 The Lord chastising hath chastised me: but he hath not delivered me over to death.</p>
<p>19 Open ye to me the gates of justice: I will go in to them, and give praise to the Lord.</p>
<p>20 This is the gate of the Lord, the just shall enter into it.</p>
<p>21 I will give glory to thee because thou hast heard me: and art become my salvation.</p>
<p>22 The stone which the builders rejected; the same is become the head of the corner.</p>
<p>23 This is the Lord&rsquo;s doing, and it is wonderful in our eyes.</p>
<p>24 This is the day which the Lord hath made: let us be glad and rejoice therein.</p>
<p>25 O Lord, save me: O Lord, give good success.</p>
<p>26 Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the Lord. We have blessed you out of the house of the Lord.</p>
<p>27 The Lord is God, and he hath shone upon us. Appoint a solemn day, with shady boughs, even to the horn of the altar.</p>
<p>28 Thou art my God, and I will praise thee: thou art my God, and I will exalt thee. I will praise thee, because thou hast heard me, and art become my salvation.</p>
<p>29 O praise ye the Lord, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
