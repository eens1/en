<p>1 Be not emulous of evildoers; nor envy them that work iniquity.</p>
<p>2 For they shall shortly wither away as grass, and as the green herbs shall quickly fall.</p>
<p>3 Trust in the Lord, and do good, and dwell in the land, and thou shalt be fed with its riches.</p>
<p>4 Delight in the Lord, and he will give thee the requests of thy heart.</p>
<p>5 Commit thy way to the Lord, and trust in him, and he will do it.</p>
<p>6 And he will bring forth thy justice as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday.</p>
<p>7 Be subject to the Lord and pray to him. Envy not the man who prospereth in his way; the man who doth unjust things.</p>
<p>8 Cease from anger, and leave rage; have no emulation to do evil.</p>
<p>9 For evildoers shall be cut off: but they that wait upon the Lord, they shall inherit the land.</p>
<p>10 For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: and thou shalt seek his place, and shalt not find it.</p>
<p>11 But the meek shall inherit the land, and shall delight in abundance of peace.</p>
<p>12 The sinner shall watch the just man: and shall gnash upon him with his teeth.</p>
<p>13 But the Lord shall laugh at him: for he foreseeth that his day shall come.</p>
<p>14 The wicked have drawn out the sword: they have bent their bow. To cast down the poor and needy, to kill the upright of heart.</p>
<p>15 Let their sword enter into their own hearts, and let their bow be broken.</p>
<p>16 Better is a little to the just, than the great riches of the wicked.</p>
<p>17 For the arms of the wicked shall be broken in pieces; but the Lord strengtheneth the just.</p>
<p>18 The Lord knoweth the days of the undefiled; and their inheritance shall be for ever.</p>
<p>19 They shall not be confounded in the evil time; and in the days of famine they shall be filled:</p>
<p>20 Because the wicked shall perish. And the enemies of the Lord, presently after they shall be honoured and exalted, shall come to nothing and vanish like smoke.</p>
<p>21 The sinner shall borrow, and not pay again; but the just sheweth mercy and shall give.</p>
<p>22 For such as bless him shall inherit the land: but such as curse him shall perish.</p>
<p>23 With the Lord shall the steps of a man be directed, and he shall like well his way.</p>
<p>24 When he shall fall he shall not be bruised, for the Lord putteth his hand under him.</p>
<p>25 I have been young and now am old; and I have not seen the just forsaken, nor his seed seeking bread.</p>
<p>26 He sheweth mercy, and lendeth all the day long; and his seed shall be in blessing.</p>
<p>27 Decline from evil and do good, and dwell for ever and ever.</p>
<p>28 For the Lord loveth judgment, and will not forsake his saints: they shall be preserved for ever. The unjust shall be punished, and the seed of the wicked shall perish.</p>
<p>29 But the just shall inherit the land, and shall dwell therein for evermore.</p>
<p>30 The mouth of the just shall meditate wisdom: and his tongue shall speak judgment.</p>
<p>31 The law of his God is in his heart, and his steps shall not be supplanted.</p>
<p>32 The wicked watcheth the just man, and seeketh to put him to death,</p>
<p>33 But the Lord will not leave him in his hands; nor condemn him when he shall be judged.</p>
<p>34 Expect the Lord and keep his way: and he will exalt thee to inherit the land: when the sinners shall perish thou shalt see.</p>
<p>35 I have seen the wicked highly exalted, and lifted up like the cedars of Libanus.</p>
<p>36 And I passed by, and lo, he was not: and I sought him and his place was not found.</p>
<p>37 Keep innocence, and behold justice: for there are remnants for the peaceable man.</p>
<p>38 But the unjust shall be destroyed together: the remnants of the wicked shall perish.</p>
<p>39 But the salvation of the just is from the Lord, and he is their protector in the time of trouble.</p>
<p>40 And the Lord will help them and deliver them: and he will rescue them from the wicked, and save them because they have hoped in him.</p>
