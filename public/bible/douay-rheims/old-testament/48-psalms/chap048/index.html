<p>1 Unto the end, a psalm for the sons of Core.</p>
<p>2 Hear these things, all ye nations: give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world.</p>
<p>3 All you that are earthborn, and you sons of men: both rich and poor together.</p>
<p>4 My mouth shall speak wisdom: and the meditation of my heart understanding.</p>
<p>5 I will incline my ear to a parable; I will open my proposition on the psaltery.</p>
<p>6 Why shall I fear in the evil day? the iniquity of my heel shall encompass me.</p>
<p>7 They that trust in their own strength, and glory in the multitude of their riches,</p>
<p>8 No brother can redeem, nor shall man redeem: he shall not give to God his ransom,</p>
<p>9 Nor the price of the redemption of his soul: and shall labour for ever,</p>
<p>10 And shall still live unto the end.</p>
<p>11 He shall not see destruction, when he shall see the wise dying: the senseless and the fool shall perish together: And they shall leave their riches to strangers:</p>
<p>12 And their sepulchres shall be their houses for ever. Their dwelling places to all generations: they have called their lands by their names.</p>
<p>13 And man when he was in honour did not understand; he is compared to senseless beasts, and is become like to them.</p>
<p>14 This way of theirs is a stumblingblock to them: and afterwards they shall delight in their mouth.</p>
<p>15 They are laid in hell like sheep: death shall feed upon them. And the just shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their help shall decay in hell from their glory.</p>
<p>16 But God will redeem my soul from the hand of hell, when he shall receive me.</p>
<p>17 Be not thou afraid, when a man shall be made rich, and when the glory of his house shall be increased.</p>
<p>18 For when he shall die he shall take nothing away; nor shall his glory descend with him.</p>
<p>19 For in his lifetime his soul will be blessed: and he will praise thee when thou shalt do well to him.</p>
<p>20 He shall go in to the generations of his fathers: and he shall never see light.</p>
<p>21 Man when he was in honour did not understand: he hath been compared to senseless beasts, and made like to them.</p>
