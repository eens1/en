<article>
<p>1 Unto the end, a psalm of a canticle for David himself.</p>
<p>2 Let God arise, and let his enemies be scattered: and let them that hate him flee from before his face.</p>
<p>3 As smoke vanisheth, so let them vanish away: as wax melteth before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God.</p>
<p>4 And let the just feast, and rejoice before God: and be delighted with gladness.</p>
<p>5 Sing ye to God, sing a psalm to his name, make a way for him who ascendeth upon the west: the Lord is his name. Rejoice ye before him: but the wicked shall be troubled at his presence,</p>
<p>6 Who is the father of orphans, and the judge of widows. God in his holy place:</p>
<p>7 God who maketh men of one manner to dwell in a house: Who bringeth out them that were bound in strength; in like manner them that provoke, that dwell in sepulchres.</p>
<p>8 O God, when thou didst go forth in the sight of thy people, when thou didst pass through the desert:</p>
<p>9 The earth was moved, and the heavens dropped at the presence of the God of Sina, at the presence of the God of Israel.</p>
<p>10 Thou shalt set aside for thy inheritance a free rain, O God: and it was weakened, but thou hast made it perfect.</p>
<p>11 In it shall thy animals dwell; in thy sweetness, O God, thou hast provided for the poor.</p>
<p>12 The Lord shall give the word to them that preach good tidings with great power.</p>
<p>13 The king of powers is of the beloved, of the beloved; and the beauty of the house shall divide spoils.</p>
<p>14 If you sleep among the midst of lots, you shall be as the wings of a dove covered with silver, and the hinder parts of her back with the paleness of gold.</p>
<p>15 When he that is in heaven appointeth kings over her, they shall be whited with snow in Selmon.</p>
<p>16 The mountain of God is a fat mountain. A curdled mountain, a fat mountain.</p>
<p>17 Why suspect, ye curdled mountains? A mountain in which God is well pleased to dwell: for there the Lord shall dwell unto the end.</p>
<p>18 The chariot of God is attended by ten thousands; thousands of them that rejoice: the Lord is among them in Sina, in the holy place.</p>
<p>19 Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive; thou hast received gifts in men. Yea for those also that do not believe, the dwelling of the Lord God.</p>
<p>20 Blessed be the Lord day by day: the God of our salvation will make our journey prosperous to us.</p>
<p>21 Our God is the God of salvation: and of the Lord, of the Lord are the issues from death.</p>
<p>22 But God shall break the heads of his enemies: the hairy crown of them that walk on in their sins.</p>
<p>23 The Lord said: I will turn them from Basan, I will turn them into the depth of the sea:</p>
<p>24 That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thy enemies; the tongue of thy dogs be red with the same.</p>
<p>25 They have seen thy goings, O God, the goings of my God: of my king who is in his sanctuary.</p>
<p>26 Princes went before joined with singers, in the midst of young damsels playing on timbrels.</p>
<p>27 In the churches bless ye God the Lord, from the fountains of Israel.</p>
<p>28 There is Benjamin a youth, in ecstasy of mind. The princes of Juda are their leaders: the princes of Zabulon, the princes of Nephthali.</p>
<p>29 Command thy strength, O God confirm, O God, what thou hast wrought in us.</p>
<p>30 From thy temple in Jerusalem, kings shall offer presents to thee.</p>
<p>31 Rebuke the wild beasts of the reeds, the congregation of bulls with the kine of the people; who seek to exclude them who are tried with silver. Scatter thou the nations that delight in wars:</p>
<p>32 Ambassadors shall come out of Egypt: Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands to God.</p>
<p>33 Sing to God, ye kingdoms of the earth: sing ye to the Lord: Sing ye to God,</p>
<p>34 Who mounteth above the heaven of heavens, to the east. Behold he will give to his voice the voice of power:</p>
<p>35 Give ye glory to God for Israel, his magnificence, and his power is in the clouds.</p>
<p>36 God is wonderful in his saints: the God of Israel is he who will give power and strength to his people. Blessed be God.</p>
