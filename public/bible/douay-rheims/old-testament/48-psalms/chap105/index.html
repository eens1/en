<p>1 Give glory to the Lord, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
<p>2 Who shall declare the powers of the Lord? who shall set forth all his praises?</p>
<p>3 Blessed are they that keep judgment, and do justice at all times.</p>
<p>4 Remember us, O Lord, in the favour of thy people: visit us with thy salvation.</p>
<p>5 That we may see the good of thy chosen, that we may rejoice in the joy of thy nation: that thou mayst be praised with thy inheritance.</p>
<p>6 We have sinned with our fathers: we have acted unjustly, we have wrought iniquity.</p>
<p>7 Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt: they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies: And they provoked to wrath going up to the sea, even the Red Sea.</p>
<p>8 And he saved them for his own name&rsquo;s sake: that he might make his power known.</p>
<p>9 And he rebuked the Red Sea and it was dried up: and he led them through the depths, as in a wilderness.</p>
<p>10 And he saved them from the hand of them that hated them: and he redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.</p>
<p>11 And the water covered them that afflicted them: there was not one of them left.</p>
<p>12 And they believed his words: and they sang his praises.</p>
<p>13 They had quickly done, they forgot his works: and they waited not for his counsel.</p>
<p>14 And they coveted their desire in the desert: and they tempted God in the place without water.</p>
<p>15 And he gave them their request: and sent fulness into their souls.</p>
<p>16 And they provoked Moses in the camp, Aaron the holy one of the Lord.</p>
<p>17 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan: and covered the congregation of Abiron.</p>
<p>18 And a fire was kindled in their congregation: the flame burned the wicked.</p>
<p>19 They made also a calf in Horeb: and they adored the graven thing.</p>
<p>20 And they changed their glory into the likeness of a calf that eateth grass.</p>
<p>21 They forgot God, who saved them, who had done great things in Egypt,</p>
<p>22 Wondrous works in the land of Cham: terrible things in the Red Sea.</p>
<p>23 And he said that he would destroy them: had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach: To turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them.</p>
<p>24 And they set at nought the desirable land. They believed not his word,</p>
<p>25 And they murmured in their tents: they hearkened not to the voice of the Lord.</p>
<p>26 And he lifted up his hand over them: to overthrow them in the desert;</p>
<p>27 And to cast down their seed among the nations, and to scatter them in the countries.</p>
<p>28 They also were initiated to Beelphegor: and ate the sacrifices of the dead.</p>
<p>29 And they provoked him with their inventions: and destruction was multiplied among them.</p>
<p>30 Then Phinees stood up, and pacified him: and the slaughter ceased.</p>
<p>31 And it was reputed to him unto justice, to generation and generation for evermore.</p>
<p>32 They provoked him also at the waters of contradiction: and Moses was afflicted for their sakes:</p>
<p>33 Because they exasperated his spirit. And he distinguished with his lips.</p>
<p>34 They did not destroy the nations of which the Lord spoke unto them.</p>
<p>35 And they were mingled among the heathens, and learned their works:</p>
<p>36 And served their idols, and it became a stumblingblock to them.</p>
<p>37 And they sacrificed their sons, and their daughters to devils.</p>
<p>38 And they shed innocent blood: the blood of their sons and of their daughters which they sacrificed to the idols of Chanaan. And the land was polluted with blood,</p>
<p>39 And was defiled with their works: and they went aside after their own inventions.</p>
<p>40 And the Lord was exceedingly angry with his people: and he abhorred his inheritance.</p>
<p>41 And he delivered them into the hands of the nations: and they that hated them had dominion over them.</p>
<p>42 And their enemies afflicted them: and they were humbled under their hands:</p>
<p>43 Many times did he deliver them. But they provoked him with their counsel: and they were brought low by their iniquities.</p>
<p>44 And he saw when they were in tribulation: and he heard their prayer.</p>
<p>45 And he was mindful of his covenant: and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.</p>
<p>46 And he gave them unto mercies, in the sight of all those that had made them captives.</p>
<p>47 Save us, O Lord, our God: and gather us from among the nations: That we may give thanks to thy holy name, and may glory in thy praise.</p>
<p>48 Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say: So be it, so be it.</p>
