<h1>Chapter 40</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Unto the end, a psalm for David himself.</p>
<p>2 Blessed is he that understandeth concerning the needy and the poor: the Lord will deliver him in the evil day.</p>
<p>3 The Lord preserve him and give him life, and make him blessed upon the earth: and deliver him not up to the will of his enemies.</p>
<p>4 The Lord help him on his bed of sorrow: thou hast turned all his couch in his sickness.</p>
<p>5 I said: O Lord, be thou merciful to me: heal my soul, for I have sinned against thee.</p>
<p>6 My enemies have spoken evils against me: when shall he die and his name perish?</p>
<p>7 And if he came in to see me, he spoke vain things: his heart gathered together iniquity to itself. He went out and spoke to the same purpose.</p>
<p>8 All my enemies whispered together against me: they devised evils to me.</p>
<p>9 They determined against me an unjust word: shall he that sleepeth rise again no more?</p>
<p>10 For even the man of my peace, in whom I trusted, who ate my bread, hath greatly supplanted me.</p>
<p>11 But thou, O Lord, have mercy on me, and raise me up again: and I will requite them.</p>
<p>12 By this I know, that thou hast had a good will for me: because my enemy shall not rejoice over me.</p>
<p>13 But thou hast upheld me by reason of my innocence: and hast established me in thy sight for ever.</p>
<p>14 Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel from eternity to eternity. So be it. So be it.</p>
