<h1>Chapter 78</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 A psalm for Asaph. O God, the heathens are come into thy inheritance, they have defiled thy holy temple: they have made Jerusalem as a place to keep fruit.</p>
<p>2 They have given the dead bodies of thy servants to be meat for the fowls of the air: the flesh of thy saints for the beasts of the earth.</p>
<p>3 They have poured out their blood as water, round about Jerusalem and there was none to bury them.</p>
<p>4 We are become a reproach to our neighbours: a scorn and derision to them that are round about us.</p>
<p>5 How long, O Lord, wilt thou be angry for ever: shall thy zeal be kindled like a fire?</p>
<p>6 Pour out thy wrath upon the nations that have not known thee: and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name.</p>
<p>7 Because they have devoured Jacob; and have laid waste his place.</p>
<p>8 Remember not our former iniquities: let thy mercies speedily prevent us, for we are become exceeding poor.</p>
<p>9 Help us, O God, our saviour: and for the glory of thy name, O Lord, deliver us: and forgive us our sins for thy name&rsquo;s sake:</p>
<p>10 Lest they should say among the Gentiles: Where is their God? And let him be made known among the nations before our eyes, By the revenging the blood of thy servants, which hath been shed:</p>
<p>11 Let the sighing of the prisoners come in before thee. According to the greatness of thy arm, take possession of the children of them that have been put to death.</p>
<p>12 And render to our neighbours sevenfold in their bosom: the reproach wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.</p>
<p>13 But we thy people, and the sheep of thy pasture, will give thanks to thee for ever. We will shew forth thy praise, unto generation and generation.</p>
