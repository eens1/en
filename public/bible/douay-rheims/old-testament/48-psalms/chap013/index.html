<h1>Chapter 13</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Unto the end, a psalm for David. The fool hath said in his heart: There is no God. They are corrupt, and are become abominable in their ways: there is none that doth good, no not one.</p>
<p>2 The Lord hath looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there be any that understand and seek God.</p>
<p>3 They are all gone aside, they are become unprofitable together: there is none that doth good: no not one. Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they acted deceitfully: the poison of asps is under their lips. Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness; their feet are swift to shed blood. Destruction and unhappiness in their ways; and the way of peace they have not known: there is no fear of God before their eyes.</p>
<p>4 Shall not all they know that work iniquity, who devour my people as they eat bread?</p>
<p>5 They have not called upon the Lord: there have they trembled for fear, where there was no fear.</p>
<p>6 For the Lord is in the just generation: you have confounded the counsel of the poor man; but the Lord is his hope.</p>
<p>7 Who shall give out of Sion the salvation of Israel? when the Lord shall have turned away the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.</p>
