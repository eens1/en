<article>
<p>1 Unto the end, for the morning protection, a psalm for David.</p>
<p>2 O God my God, look upon me: why hast thou forsaken me? Far from my salvation are the words of my sins.</p>
<p>3 O my God, I shall cry by day, and thou wilt not hear: and by night, and it shall not be reputed as folly in me.</p>
<p>4 But thou dwellest in the holy place, the praise of Israel.</p>
<p>5 In thee have our fathers hoped: they have hoped, and thou hast delivered them.</p>
<p>6 They cried to thee, and they were saved: they trusted in thee, and were not confounded.</p>
<p>7 But I am a worm, and no man: the reproach of men, and the outcast of the people.</p>
<p>8 All they that saw me have laughed me to scorn: they have spoken with the lips, and wagged the head.</p>
<p>9 He hoped in the Lord, let him deliver him: let him save him, seeing he delighteth in him.</p>
<p>10 For thou art he that hast drawn me out of the womb: my hope from the breasts of my mother.</p>
<p>11 I was cast upon thee from the womb. From my mother&rsquo;s womb thou art my God,</p>
<p>12 Depart not from me. For tribulation is very near: for there is none to help me.</p>
<p>13 Many calves have surrounded me: fat bulls have besieged me.</p>
<p>14They have opened their mouths against me, as a lion ravening and roaring.</p>
<p>15 I am poured out like water; and all my bones are scattered. My heart is become like wax melting in the midst of my bowels.</p>
<p>16 My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue hath cleaved to my jaws: and thou hast brought me down into the dust of death.</p>
<p>17 For many dogs have encompassed me: the council of the malignant hath besieged me. They have dug my hands and feet.</p>
<p>18 They have numbered all my bones. And they have looked and stared upon me.</p>
<p>19 They parted my garments amongst them; and upon my vesture they cast lots.</p>
<p>20 But thou, O Lord, remove not thy help to a distance from me; look towards my defence.</p>
<p>21 Deliver, O God, my soul from the sword: my only one from the hand of the dog.</p>
<p>22 Save me from the lion&rsquo;s mouth; and my lowness from the horns of the unicorns.</p>
<p>23 I will declare thy name to my brethren: in the midst of the church will I praise thee.</p>
<p>24 Ye that fear the Lord, praise him: all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him.</p>
<p>25 Let all the seed of Israel fear him: because he hath not slighted nor despised the supplication of the poor man. Neither hath he turned away his face from me: and when I cried to him he heard me.</p>
<p>26 With thee is my praise in a great church: I will pay my vows in the sight of them that fear him.</p>
<p>27 The poor shall eat and shall be filled: and they shall praise the Lord that seek him: their hearts shall live for ever and ever.</p>
<p>28 All the ends of the earth shall remember, and shall be converted to the Lord: And all the kindreds of the Gentiles shall adore in his sight.</p>
<p>29 For the kingdom is the Lord&rsquo;s; and he shall have dominion over the nations.</p>
<p>30 All the fat ones of the earth have eaten and have adored: all they that go down to the earth shall fall before him.</p>
<p>31 And to him my soul shall live: and my seed shall serve him.</p>
<p>32 There shall be declared to the Lord a generation to come: and the heavens shall shew forth his justice to a people that shall be born, which the Lord hath made.</p>
