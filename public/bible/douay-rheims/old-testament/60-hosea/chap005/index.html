<article>
<p>1 Hear ye this, O priests, and hearken, O ye house of Israel, and give ear, O house of the king: for there is a judgment against you, because you have been a snare to them whom you should have watched over and a net spread upon Thabor.</p>
<p>2 And you have turned aside victims into the depth and I am the teacher of them all.</p>
<p>3 I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me for now Ephraim hath committed fornication, Israel is defiled.</p>
<p>4 They will not set their thoughts to return to their God: for the spirit of fornication is in the midst of them, and they have not known the Lord.</p>
<p>5 And the pride of Israel shall answer in his face: and Israel, and Ephraim shall fall in their iniquity, Juda also shall fall with them.</p>
<p>6 With their flocks and with their herds, they shall go to seek the Lord, and shall not find him: he is withdrawn from them.</p>
<p>7 They have transgressed against the Lord: for they have begotten children that are strangers: now shall a month devour them with their portions.</p>
<p>8 Blow ye the cornet in Gabaa, the trumpet in Rama: howl ye in Bethaven, behind thy back, O Benjamin.</p>
<p>9 Ephraim shall be in desolation in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel I have shewn that which shall surely be.</p>
<p>10 The princes of Juda are become as they that take up the bound: I will pour out my wrath upon them like water.</p>
<p>11 Ephraim is under oppression, and broken in judgment: because he began to go after filthiness.</p>
<p>12 And I will be like a moth to Ephraim: and like rottenness to the house of Juda.</p>
<p>13 And Ephraim saw his sickness, and Juda his band: and Ephraim went to the Assyrian, and sent to the avenging king: and he shall not be able to heal you, neither shall he be able to take off the band from you.</p>
<p>14 For I will be like a lioness to Ephraim, and like a lion&rsquo;s whelp to the house of Juda: I, I will catch, and go: I will take away, and there is none that can rescue.</p>
<p>15 I will go and return to my place: until you are consumed, and seek my face.</p>
