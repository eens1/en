<h1>Chapter 8</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Let there be a trumpet in thy throat like an eagle upon the house of the Lord: because they have transgressed my covenant, and have violated my law.</p>
<p>2 They shall call upon me: O my God, we, Israel, know thee.</p>
<p>3 Israel hath cast off the thing that is good, the enemy shall pursue him.</p>
<p>4 They have reigned, but not by me: they have been princes, and I knew not: of their silver and their gold they have made idols to themselves, that they might perish.</p>
<p>5 Thy calf, O Samaria, is cast off, my wrath is kindled against them. How long will they be incapable of being cleansed?</p>
<p>6 For itself also is the invention of Israel: a workman made it, and it is no god: for the calf of Samaria shall be turned to spiders&rsquo; webs.</p>
<p>7 For they shall sow wind, and reap a whirlwind, there is no standing stalk in it, the bud shall yield no meal; and if it should yield, strangers shall eat it.</p>
<p>8 Israel is swallowed up: now is he become among the nations like an unclean vessel.</p>
<p>9 For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim hath given gifts to his lovers.</p>
<p>10 But even though they shall have hired the nations, now will I gather them together: and they shall rest a while from the burden of the king, and the princes.</p>
<p>11 Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin: altars are become to him unto sin.</p>
<p>12 I shall write to him my manifold laws, which have been accounted as foreign.</p>
<p>13 They shall offer victims, they shall sacrifice flesh, and shall eat it, and the Lord will not receive them: now will he remember their iniquity, and will visit their sins: they shall return to Egypt.</p>
<p>14 And Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and hath built temples: and Juda hath built many fenced cities: and I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the houses thereof.</p>
