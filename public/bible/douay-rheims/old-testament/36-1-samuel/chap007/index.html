<h1>Chapter 7</h1>

<div class="content">

<p>1 And the men of Cariathiarim came, and fetched up the ark of the Lord, and carried it into the house of Abinadab, in Gabaa: and they sanctified Eleazar, his son, to keep the ark of the Lord.</p>
<p>2 And it came to pass, that from the day the ark of the Lord abode in Cariathiarim, days were multiplied (for it was now the twentieth year) and all the house of Israel rested, following the Lord.</p>
<p>3 And Samuel spoke to all the house of Israel, saying: If you turn to the Lord with all your heart, put away the strange gods from among you, Baalim and Astaroth: and prepare your hearts unto the Lord, and serve him only, and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.</p>
<p>4 Then the children of Israel put away Baalim and Astaroth, and served the Lord only.</p>
<p>5 And Samuel said: Gather all Israel to Masphath, that I may pray to the Lord for you.</p>
<p>6 And they gathered together to Masphath, and they drew water, and poured it out before the Lord, and they fasted on that day, and they said there: We have sinned against the Lord. And Samuel judged the children of Israel in Masphath.</p>
<p>7 And the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to Masphath, and the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard this, they were afraid of the Philistines.</p>
<p>8 And they said to Samuel: Cease not to cry to the Lord our God for us, that he may save us out of the hand of the Philistines.</p>
<p>9 And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it whole for a holocaust to the Lord: and Samuel cried to the Lord for Israel, and the Lord heard him.</p>
<p>10 And it came to pass, when Samuel was offering the holocaust, the Philistines began the battle against Israel: but the Lord thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines, and terrified them, and they were overthrown before the face of Israel.</p>
<p>11 And the men of Israel going out of Masphath, pursued after the Philistines, and made slaughter of them till they came under Bethchar.</p>
<p>12 And Samuel took a stone, and laid it between Masphath and Sen: and he called the place The stone of help. And he said: Thus far the Lord hath helped us.</p>
<p>13 And the Philistines were humbled, and they did not come any more into the borders of Israel. And the hand of the Lord was against the Philistines, all the days of Samuel.</p>
<p>14 And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel, were restored to Israel, from Accaron to Geth, and their borders: and he delivered Israel from the hand of the Philistines, and there was peace between Israel and the Amorrhites.</p>
<p>15 And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life:</p>
<p>16 And he went every year about to Bethel and to Galgal and to Masphath, and he judged Israel in the foresaid places.</p>
<p>17 And he returned to Ramatha: for there was his house, and there he judged Israel: he built also there an altar to the Lord.</p>
