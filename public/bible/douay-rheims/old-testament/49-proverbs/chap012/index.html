<h1>Chapter 12</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 He that loveth correction, loveth knowledge: but he that hateth reproof, is foolish.</p>
<p>2 He that is good, shall draw grace from the Lord: but he that trusteth in his own devices, doth wickedly.</p>
<p>3 Man shall not be strengthened by wickedness: and the root of the just shall not be moved.</p>
<p>4 A diligent woman is a crown to her husband: and she that doth things worthy of confusion, is as rottenness in his bones.</p>
<p>5 The thoughts of the just are judgments: and the counsels of the wicked are deceitful.</p>
<p>6 The words of the wicked lie in wait for blood: the mouth of the just shall deliver them.</p>
<p>7 Turn the wicked, and they shall not be: but the house of the just shall stand firm.</p>
<p>8 A man shall be known by his learning: but he that is vain and foolish, shall be exposed to contempt.</p>
<p>9 Better is the poor man that provideth for himself, than he that is glorious and wanteth bread.</p>
<p>10 The just regardeth the lives of his beasts: but the bowels of the wicked are cruel.</p>
<p>11 He that tilleth his land shall be satisfied with bread: but he that pursueth idleness is very foolish.</p>
<p>12 He that is delighted in passing his time over wine, leaveth a reproach in his strong holds.</p>
<p>12 The desire of the wicked is the fortification of evil men: but the root of the just shall prosper.</p>
<p>13 For the sins of the lips ruin draweth nigh to the evil man: but the just shall escape out of distress.</p>
<p>14 By the fruit of his own mouth shall a man be filled with good things, and according to the works of his hands it shall be repaid him.</p>
<p>15 The way of a fool is right in his own eyes: but he that is wise hearkeneth unto counsels.</p>
<p>16 A fool immediately sheweth his anger: but he that dissembleth injuries is wise.</p>
<p>17 He that speaketh that which he knoweth, sheweth forth justice: but he that lieth, is a deceitful witness.</p>
<p>18 There is that promiseth, and is pricked as it were with a sword of conscience: but the tongue of the wise is health.</p>
<p>19 The lip of truth shall be steadfast for ever: but he that is a hasty witness, frameth a lying tongue.</p>
<p>20 Deceit is in the heart of them that think evil things: but joy followeth them that take counsels of peace.</p>
<p>21 Whatsoever shall befall the just man, shall not make him sad: but the wicked shall be filled with mischief.</p>
<p>22 Lying lips are an abomination to the Lord: but they that deal faithfully, please him.</p>
<p>23 A cautious man concealeth knowledge: and the heart of fools publisheth folly.</p>
<p>24 The hand of the valiant shall bear rule: but that which is slothful shall be under tribute.</p>
<p>25 Grief in the heart of a man shall bring him low, but with a good word he shall be made glad.</p>
<p>26 He that neglecteth a loss for the sake of a friend, is just: but the way of the wicked shall deceive them.</p>
<p>27 The deceitful man shall not find gain: but the substance of a just man shall be precious gold.</p>
<p>28 In the path of justice is life: but the bye-way leadeth to death.</p>
