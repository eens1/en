<article>
<p>1 Better is a dry morsel with joy, than a house full of victims with strife.</p>
<p>2 A wise servant shall rule over foolish sons, and shall divide the inheritance among the brethren.</p>
<p>3 As silver is tried by fire, and gold in the furnace: so the Lord trieth the hearts.</p>
<p>4 The evil man obeyeth an unjust tongue: and the deceitful hearkeneth to lying lips.</p>
<p>5 He that despiseth the poor, reproacheth his maker: and he that rejoiceth at another man&rsquo;s ruin, shall not be unpunished.</p>
<p>6 Children&rsquo;s children are the crown of old men: and the glory of children are their fathers.</p>
<p>7 Eloquent words do not become a fool, nor lying lips a prince.</p>
<p>8 The expectation of him that expecteth is a most acceptable jewel: whithersoever he turneth himself, he understandeth wisely.</p>
<p>9 He that concealeth a transgression, seeketh friendships: he that repeateth it again, separateth friends.</p>
<p>10 A reproof availeth more with a wise man, than a hundred stripes with a fool.</p>
<p>11 An evil man always seeketh quarrels: but a cruel angel shall be sent against him.</p>
<p>12 It is better to meet a bear robbed of her whelps, than a fool trusting in his own folly.</p>
<p>13 He that rendereth evil for good, evil shall not depart from his house.</p>
<p>14 The beginning of quarrels is as when one letteth out water: and before he suffereth reproach, he forsaketh judgment.</p>
<p>15 He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the just, both are abominable before God.</p>
<p>16 What doth it avail a fool to have riches, seeing he cannot buy wisdom? He that maketh his house high, seeketh a downfall: and he that refuseth to learn, shall fall into evils.</p>
<p>17 He that is a friend loveth at all times: and a brother is proved in distress.</p>
<p>18 A foolish man will clap hands, when he is surety for his friend.</p>
<p>19 He that studieth discords, loveth quarrels: and he that exalteth his door, seeketh ruin.</p>
<p>20 He that is of a perverse heart, shall not find good: and he that perverteth his tongue, shall fall into evil.</p>
<p>21 A fool is born to his own disgrace: and even his father shall not rejoice in a fool.</p>
<p>22 A joyful mind maketh age flourishing: a sorrowful spirit drieth up the bones.</p>
<p>23 The wicked man taketh gifts out of the bosom, that he may pervert the paths of judgment.</p>
<p>24 Wisdom shineth in the face of the wise: the eyes of fools are in the ends of the earth.</p>
<p>25 A foolish son is the anger of the father: and the sorrow of the mother that bore him.</p>
<p>26 It is no good thing to do hurt to the just: nor to strike the prince, who judgeth right.</p>
<p>27 He that setteth bounds to his words, is knowing and wise: and the man of understanding is of a precious spirit.</p>
<p>28 Even a fool, if he will hold his peace, shall be counted wise: and if he close his lips, a man of understanding.</p>
