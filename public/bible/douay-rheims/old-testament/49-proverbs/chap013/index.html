<p>1 A wise son heareth the doctrine of his father: but he that is a scorner, heareth not when he is reproved.</p>
<p>2 Of the fruit of his own month shall a man be filled with good things: but the soul of transgressors is wicked.</p>
<p>3 He that keepeth his mouth keepeth his soul: but he that hath no guard on his speech shall meet with evils.</p>
<p>4 The sluggard willeth, and willeth not: but the soul of them that work, shall be made fat.</p>
<p>5 The just shall hate a lying word: but the wicked confoundeth, and shall be confounded.</p>
<p>6 Justice keepeth the way of the innocent: but wickedness overthroweth the sinner.</p>
<p>7 One is as it were rich, when he hath nothing and another is as it were poor, when he hath great riches.</p>
<p>8 The ransom of a man&rsquo;s life are his riches: but he that is poor, beareth not reprehension.</p>
<p>9 The light of the just giveth joy: but the lamp of the wicked shall be put out.</p>
<p>10 Among the proud there are always contentions: but they that do all things with counsel, are ruled by wisdom.</p>
<p>11 Substance got in haste shall be diminished: but that which by little and little is gathered with the hand, shall increase.</p>
<p>12 Hope that is deferred afflicteth the soul: desire when it cometh, is a tree of life.</p>
<p>13 Whosoever speaketh ill of any thing, bindeth himself for the time to come: but he that feareth the commandment, shall dwell in peace. Deceitful souls go astray in sins: the just are merciful, and shew mercy.</p>
<p>14 The law of the wise is a fountain of life, that he may decline from the ruin of death.</p>
<p>15 Good instruction shall give grace: in the way of scorners is a deep pit.</p>
<p>16 The prudent man doth all things with counsel: but he that is a fool, layeth open his folly.</p>
<p>17 The messenger of the wicked shall fall into mischief: but a faithful ambassador is health.</p>
<p>18 Poverty and shame to him that refuseth instruction: but he that yieldeth to reproof shall be glorified.</p>
<p>19 The desire that is accomplished, delighteth the soul: fools hate them that flee from evil things.</p>
<p>20 He that walketh with the wise, shall be wise: a friend of fools shall become like to them.</p>
<p>21 Evil pursueth sinners: and to the just good shall be repaid.</p>
<p>22 The good man leaveth heirs, sons, and grandsons: and the substance of the sinner is kept for the just.</p>
<p>23 Much food is in the tillage of fathers: but for others it is gathered without judgment.</p>
<p>24 He that spareth the rod, hateth his son: but he that loveth him, correcteth him betimes.</p>
<p>25 The just eateth and filleth his soul: but the belly of the wicked is never to be filled.</p>
