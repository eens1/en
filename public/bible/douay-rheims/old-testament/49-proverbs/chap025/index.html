<article>
<p>1 These are also parables of Solomon, which the men of Ezechias, king of Juda, copied out.</p>
<p>2 It is the glory of God to conceal the word, and the glory of kings to search out the speech.</p>
<p>3 The heaven above and the earth beneath, and the heart of kings is unsearchable.</p>
<p>4 Take away the rust from silver, and there shall come forth a most pure vessel:</p>
<p>5 Take away wickedness from the face of the king, and his throne shall be established with justice.</p>
<p>6 Appear not glorious before the king, and stand not in the place of great men.</p>
<p>7 For it is better that it should be said to thee: Come up hither; than that thou shouldst be humbled before the prince.</p>
<p>8 The things which thy eyes have seen, utter not hastily in a quarrel: lest afterward thou mayst not be able to make amends, when thou hast dishonoured thy friend.</p>
<p>9 Treat thy cause with thy friend, and discover not the secret to a stranger:</p>
<p>10 Lest he insult over thee, when he hath heard it, and cease not to upbraid thee. Grace and friendship deliver a man: keep these for thyself, lest thou fall under reproach.</p>
<p>11 To speak a word in due time, is like apples of gold on beds of silver.</p>
<p>12 As an earring of gold and a bright pearl, so is he that reproveth the wise, and the obedient ear.</p>
<p>13 As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful messenger to him that sent him, for he refresheth his soul.</p>
<p>14 As clouds, and wind, when no rain followeth, so is the man that boasteth, and doth not fulfil his promises.</p>
<p>15 By patience a prince shall be appeased, and a soft tongue shall break hardness.</p>
<p>16 Thou hast found honey, eat what is sufficient for thee, lest being glutted therewith thou vomit it up.</p>
<p>17 Withdraw thy foot from the house of thy neighbour, lest having his fill he hate thee.</p>
<p>18 A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour, is like a dart and a sword and a sharp arrow.</p>
<p>19 To trust in an unfaithful man in the time of trouble, is like a rotten tooth, and weary foot,</p>
<p>20 And one that looseth his garment in cold weather. As vinegar upon nitre, so is he that singeth songs to a very evil heart. As a moth doth by a garment, and a worm by the wood: so the sadness of a man consumeth the heart.</p>
<p>21 If thy enemy be hungry, give him to eat: if he thirst, give him water to drink:</p>
<p>22 For thou shalt heap hot coals upon his head, and the Lord will reward thee.</p>
<p>23 The north wind driveth away rain, as doth a sad countenance a backbiting tongue.</p>
<p>24 It is better to sit in a corner of the housetop: than with a brawling woman, and in a common house.</p>
<p>25 As cold water to a thirsty soul, so are good tidings from a far country.</p>
<p>26 A just man falling down before the wicked, is as a fountain troubled with the foot and a corrupted spring.</p>
<p>27 As it is not good for a man to eat much honey, so he that is a searcher of majesty shall be overwhelmed by glory.</p>
<p>28 As a city that lieth open and is not compassed with walls, so is a man that cannot refrain his own spirit in speaking.</p>
