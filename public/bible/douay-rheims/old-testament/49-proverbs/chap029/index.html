<p>1 The man that with a stiff neck despiseth him that reproveth him, shall suddenly be destroyed: and health shall not follow him.</p>
<p>2 When just men increase, the people shall rejoice: when the wicked shall bear rule, the people shall mourn.</p>
<p>3 A man that loveth wisdom, rejoiceth his father: but he that maintaineth harlots, shall squander away his substance.</p>
<p>4 A just king setteth up the land: a covetous man shall destroy it.</p>
<p>5 A man that speaketh to his friend with flattering and dissembling words, spreadeth a net for his feet.</p>
<p>6 A snare shall entangle the wicked man when he sinneth: and the just shall praise and rejoice.</p>
<p>7 The just taketh notice of the cause of the poor: the wicked is void of knowledge.</p>
<p>8 Corrupt men bring a city to ruin: but wise men turn away wrath.</p>
<p>9 If a wise man contend with a fool, whether he be angry, or laugh, he shall find no rest.</p>
<p>10 Bloodthirsty men hate the upright: but just men seek his soul.</p>
<p>11 A fool uttereth all his mind: a wise man deferreth, and keepeth it till afterwards.</p>
<p>12 A prince that gladly heareth lying words, hath all his servants wicked.</p>
<p>13 The poor man and the creditor have met one another: the Lord is the enlightener of them both.</p>
<p>14 The king that judgeth the poor in truth, his throne shall be established for ever.</p>
<p>15 The rod and reproof give wisdom: but the child that is left to his own will, bringeth his mother to shame.</p>
<p>16 When the wicked are multiplied, crimes shall be multiplied: but the just shall see their downfall.</p>
<p>17 Instruct thy son and he shall refresh thee, and shall give delight to thy soul.</p>
<p>18 When prophecy shall fail, the people shall be scattered abroad: but he that keepeth the law, is blessed.</p>
<p>19 A slave will not be corrected by words: because he understandeth what thou sayest, and will not answer.</p>
<p>20 Hast thou seen a man hasty to speak? folly is rather to be looked for, than his amendment.</p>
<p>21 He that nourisheth his servant delicately from his childhood, afterwards shall find him stubborn.</p>
<p>22 A passionate man provoketh quarrels: and he that is easily stirred up to wrath, shall be more prone to sin.</p>
<p>23 Humiliation followeth the proud: and glory shall uphold the humble of spirit.</p>
<p>24 He that is partaker with a thief, hateth his own soul: he heareth one putting him to his oath, and discovereth not.</p>
<p>25 He that feareth man shall quickly fall: he that trusteth in the Lord, shall be set on high.</p>
<p>26 Many seek the face of the prince: but the judgment of every one cometh forth from the Lord.</p>
<p>27 The just abhor a wicked man: and the wicked loathe them that are in the right way. The son that keepeth the word, shall be free from destruction.</p>
