<p>1 Better is the poor man, that walketh in his simplicity, than a rich man that is perverse in his lips and unwise.</p>
<p>2 Where there is no knowledge of the soul, there is no good: and he that is hasty with his feet shall stumble.</p>
<p>3 The folly of a man supplanteth his steps: and he fretteth in his mind against God.</p>
<p>4 Riches make many friends: but from the poor man, even they whom he had, depart.</p>
<p>5 A false witness shall not be unpunished: and he that speaketh lies, shall not escape.</p>
<p>6 Many honour the person of him that is mighty, and are friends of him that giveth gifts.</p>
<p>7 The brethren of the poor man hate him: moreover also his friends have departed far from him. He that followeth after words only, shall have nothing.</p>
<p>8 But he that possesseth a mind, loveth his own soul, and he that keepeth prudence, shall find good things.</p>
<p>9 A false witness shall not be unpunished: and he that speaketh lies, shall perish.</p>
<p>10 Delicacies are not seemly for a fool: nor for a servant to have rule over princes.</p>
<p>11 The learning of a man is known by patience: and his glory is to pass over wrongs.</p>
<p>12 As the roaring of a lion, so also is the anger of a king: and his cheerfulness as the dew upon the grass.</p>
<p>13 A foolish son is the grief of his father: and a wrangling wife is like a roof continually dropping through.</p>
<p>14 House and riches are given by parents: but a prudent wife is properly from the Lord.</p>
<p>15 Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep, and an idle soul shall suffer hunger.</p>
<p>16 He that keepeth the commandment, keepeth his own soul: but he that neglecteth his own way, shall die.</p>
<p>17 He that hath mercy on the poor, lendeth to the Lord: and he will repay him.</p>
<p>18 Chastise thy son, despair not: but to the killing of him set not thy soul.</p>
<p>19 He that is impatient, shall suffer damage: and when he shall take away, he shall add another thing.</p>
<p>20 Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayst be wise in thy latter end.</p>
<p>21 There are many thoughts in the heart of a man: but the will of the Lord shall stand firm.</p>
<p>22 A needy man is merciful: and better is the poor than the lying man.</p>
<p>23 The fear of the Lord is unto life: and he shall abide in the fulness without being visited with evil.</p>
<p>24 The slothful hideth his hand under his armpit, and will not so much as bring it to his mouth.</p>
<p>25 The wicked man being scourged, the fool shall be wiser: but if thou rebuke a wise man, he will understand discipline.</p>
<p>26 He that afflicteth his father, and chaseth away his mother, is infamous and unhappy.</p>
<p>27 Cease not, O my son, to hear instruction, and be not ignorant of the words of knowledge.</p>
<p>28 An unjust witness scorneth judgment: and the mouth of the wicked devoureth iniquity.</p>
<p>29 Judgments are prepared for scorners: and striking hammers for the bodies of fools.</p>
