<p>1 As snow in summer, and rain in harvest, so glory is not seemly for a fool.</p>
<p>2 As a bird flying to other places, and a sparrow going here or there: so a curse uttered without cause shall come upon a man.</p>
<p>3 A whip for a horse, and a snaffle for an ass, and a rod for the back of fools.</p>
<p>4 Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou be made like him.</p>
<p>5 Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he imagine himself to be wise.</p>
<p>6 He that sendeth words by a foolish messenger, is lame of feet and drinketh iniquity.</p>
<p>7 As a lame man hath fair legs in vain: so a parable is unseemly in the mouth of fools.</p>
<p>8 As he that casteth a stone into the heap of Mercury: so is he that giveth honour to a fool.</p>
<p>9 As if a thorn should grow in the hand of a drunkard: so is a parable in the mouth of fools.</p>
<p>10 Judgment determineth causes: and he that putteth a fool to silence, appeaseth anger.</p>
<p>11 As a dog that returneth to his vomit, so is the fool that repeateth his folly.</p>
<p>12 Hast thou seen a man wise in his own conceit? there shall be more hope of a fool than of him.</p>
<p>13 The slothful man saith: There is a lion in the way, and a lioness in the roads.</p>
<p>14 As the door turneth upon its hinges, so doth the slothful upon his bed.</p>
<p>15 The slothful hideth his hand under his armpit, and it grieveth him to turn it to his mouth.</p>
<p>16 The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit, than seven men that speak sentences.</p>
<p>17 As he that taketh a dog by the ears, so is he that passeth by in anger, and meddleth with another man&rsquo;s quarrel.</p>
<p>18 As he is guilty that shooteth arrows, and lances unto death.</p>
<p>19 So is the man that hurteth his friend deceitfully: and when he is taken, saith: I did it in jest.</p>
<p>20 When the wood faileth, the fire shall go out: and when the talebearer is taken away, contentions shall cease.</p>
<p>21 As coals are to burning coals, and wood to fire, so an angry man stirreth up strife.</p>
<p>22 The words of a talebearer are as it were simple, but they reach to the innermost parts of the belly.</p>
<p>23 Swelling lips joined with a corrupt heart, are like an earthern vessel adorned with silver dross.</p>
<p>24 An enemy is known by his lips, when in his heart he entertaineth deceit.</p>
<p>25 When he shall speak low, trust him not: because there are seven mischiefs in his heart.</p>
<p>26 He that covereth hatred deceitfully, his malice shall be laid open in the public assembly.</p>
<p>27 He that diggeth a pit, shall fall into it: and he that rolleth a stone, it shall return to him.</p>
<p>28 A deceitful tongue loveth not truth: and a slippery mouth worketh ruin.</p>
