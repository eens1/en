<p>1 A deceitful balance is an abomination before the Lord: and a just weight is his will.</p>
<p>2 Where pride is, there also shall be reproach: but where humility is, there also is wisdom.</p>
<p>3 The simplicity of the just shall guide them: and the deceitfulness of the wicked shall destroy them.</p>
<p>4 Riches shall not profit in the day of revenge: but justice shall deliver from death.</p>
<p>5 The justice of the upright shall make his way prosperous: and the wicked man shall fall by his own wickedness.</p>
<p>6 The justice of the righteous shall deliver them: and the unjust shall be caught in their own snares.</p>
<p>7 When the wicked man is dead, there shall be no hope any more: and the expectation of the solicitous shall perish.</p>
<p>8 The just is delivered out of distress: and the wicked shall be given up for him.</p>
<p>9 The dissembler with his mouth deceiveth his friend: but the just shall be delivered by knowledge.</p>
<p>10 When it goeth well with the just, the city shall rejoice: and when the wicked perish, there shall be praise.</p>
<p>11 By the blessing of the just the city shall be exalted: and by the mouth of the wicked it shall be overthrown.</p>
<p>12 He that despiseth his friend, is mean of heart: but the wise man will hold his peace.</p>
<p>13 He that walketh deceitfully, revealeth secrets: but he that is faithful, concealeth the thing committed to him by his friend.</p>
<p>14 Where there is no governor, the people shall fall: but there is safety where there is much counsel.</p>
<p>15 He shall be afflicted with evil, that is surety for a stranger: but he that is aware of snares, shall be secure.</p>
<p>16 A gracious woman shall find glory: and the strong shall have riches.</p>
<p>17 A merciful man doth good to his own soul: but he that is cruel casteth off even his own kindred.</p>
<p>18 The wicked maketh an unsteady work: but to him that soweth justice, there is a faithful reward.</p>
<p>19 Clemency prepareth life: and the pursuing of evil things, death.</p>
<p>20 A perverse heart is abominable to the Lord: and his will is in them that walk sincerely.</p>
<p>21 Hand in hand the evil man shall not be innocent: but the seed of the just shall be saved.</p>
<p>22 A golden ring in a swine&rsquo;s snout, a woman fair and foolish.</p>
<p>23 The desire of the just is all good, the expectation of the wicked is indignation.</p>
<p>24 Some distribute their own goods, and grow richer: others take away what is not their own, and are always in want.</p>
<p>25 The soul that blesseth, shall be made fat: and he that inebriateth, shall be inebriated also himself.</p>
<p>26 He that hideth up corn, shall be cursed among the people: but a blessing upon the head of them that sell.</p>
<p>27 Well doth he rise early who seeketh good things; but he that seeketh after evil things, shall be oppressed by them.</p>
<p>28 He that trusteth in his riches shall fall: but the just shall spring up as a green leaf.</p>
<p>29 He that troubleth his own house, shall inherit the winds: and the fool shall serve the wise.</p>
<p>30 The fruit of the just man is a tree of life: and he that gaineth souls is wise.</p>
<p>31 If the just man receive in the earth, how much more the wicked and the sinner.</p>
