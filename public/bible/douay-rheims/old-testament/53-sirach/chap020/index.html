<p>1 How much better is it to reprove, than to be angry, and not to hinder him that confesseth in prayer.</p>
<p>2 The lust of an eunuch shall deflour a young maiden:</p>
<p>3 So is he that by violence executeth of the unwise.</p>
<p>4 How good is it, when thou art reproved, to shew repentance! for so thou shalt escape wilful sin.</p>
<p>5 There is one that holdeth his peace, that is found wise: and there is another that is hateful, that is bold in speech.</p>
<p>6 There is one that holdeth his peace, because he knoweth not what to say: and there is another that holdeth his peace, knowing the proper time.</p>
<p>7 A wise man will hold his peace till he see opportunity: but a babbler, and a fool, will regard no time.</p>
<p>8 He that useth many words shall hurt his own soul: and he that taketh authority to himself unjustly shall be hated.</p>
<p>9 There is success in evil things to a man without discipline, and there is a finding that turneth to loss.</p>
<p>10 There is a gift that is not profitable: and there is a gift, the recompense of which is double.</p>
<p>11 There is an abasement because of glory: and there is one that shall lift up his head from a low estate.</p>
<p>12 There is that buyeth much for a small price, and restoreth the same sevenfold.</p>
<p>13 A man wise in words shall make himself beloved: but the graces of fools shall be poured out.</p>
<p>14 The gift of the fool shall do thee no good: for his eyes are sevenfold.</p>
<p>15 He will give a few things, and upbraid much: and the opening of his mouth is the kindling of a fire.</p>
<p>16 To day a man lendeth, and to morrow he asketh it again: such a man as this is hateful.</p>
<p>17 A fool shall have no friend, and there shall be no thanks for his good deeds.</p>
<p>18 For they that eat his bread, are of a false tongue. How often, and how many will laugh him to scorn!</p>
<p>19 For he doth not distribute with right understanding that which was to be had: in like manner also that which was not to be had.</p>
<p>20 The slipping of a false tongue is as one that falleth on the pavement: so the fall of the wicked shall come speedily.</p>
<p>21 A man without grace is as a vain fable, it shall be continually in the mouth of the unwise.</p>
<p>22 A parable coming out of a fool&rsquo;s mouth shall be rejected: for he doth not speak it in due season.</p>
<p>23 There is that is hindered from sinning through want, and in his rest he shall be pricked.</p>
<p>24 There is that will destroy his own soul through shamefacedness, and by occasion of an unwise person he will destroy it: and by respect of person he will destroy himself.</p>
<p>25 There is that for bashfulness promiseth to his friend, and maketh him his enemy for nothing.</p>
<p>26 A lie is a foul blot in a man, and yet it will be continually in the mouth of men without discipline.</p>
<p>27 A thief is better than a man that is always lying: but both of them shall inherit destruction.</p>
<p>28 The manners of lying men are without honour: and their confusion is with them without ceasing.</p>
<p>29 A wise man shall advance himself with his words, and a prudent man shall please the great ones.</p>
<p>30 He that tilleth his land shall make a high heap of corn: and he that worketh justice shall be exalted: and he that pleaseth great men shall escape iniquity.</p>
<p>31 Presents and gifts blind the eyes of judges, and make them dumb in the mouth, so that they cannot correct.</p>
<p>32 O Wisdom that is hid, and treasure that is not seen: what profit is there in them both?</p>
<p>33 Better is he that hideth his folly, than the man that hideth his wisdom.</p>
