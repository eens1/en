<p>1 He that keepeth the law, multiplieth offerings.</p>
<p>2 It is a wholesome sacrifice to take heed to the commandments, and to depart from all iniquity.</p>
<p>3 And to depart from injustice, is to offer a propitiatory sacrifice for injustices, and a begging of pardon for sins.</p>
<p>4 He shall return thanks, that offereth fine flour: and he that doth mercy, offereth sacrifice.</p>
<p>5 To depart from iniquity is that which pleaseth the Lord, and to depart from injustice, is an entreaty for sins.</p>
<p>6 Thou shalt not appear empty in the sight of the Lord.</p>
<p>7 For all these things are to be done because of the commandment of God.</p>
<p>8 The oblation of the just maketh the altar fat, and is an odour of sweetness in the sight of the most High.</p>
<p>9 The sacrifice of the just is acceptable, and the Lord will not forget the memorial thereof.</p>
<p>10 Give glory to God with a good heart: and diminish not the firstfruits of thy hands.</p>
<p>11 In every gift shew a cheerful countenance, and sanctify thy tithes with joy.</p>
<p>12 Give to the most High according to what he hath given to thee, and with a good eye do according to the ability of thy hands:</p>
<p>13 For the Lord maketh recompense, and will give thee seven times as much.</p>
<p>14 Do not offer wicked gifts, for such he will not receive.</p>
<p>15 And look not upon an unjust sacrifice, for the Lord is judge, and there is not with him respect of person.</p>
<p>16 The Lord will not accept any person against a poor man, and he will hear the prayer of him that is wronged.</p>
<p>17 He will not despise the prayers of the fatherless: nor the widow, when she poureth out her complaint.</p>
<p>18 Do not the widow&rsquo;s tears run down the cheek, and her cry against him that causeth them to fall?</p>
<p>19 For from the cheek they go up even to heaven, and the Lord that heareth will not be delighted with them.</p>
<p>20 He that adoreth God with joy, shall be accepted, and his prayer shall approach even to the clouds.</p>
<p>21 The prayer of him that humbleth himself, shall pierce the clouds: and till it come nigh he will not be comforted: and he will not depart till the most High behold.</p>
<p>22 And the Lord will not be slack, but will judge for the just, and will do judgment: and the Almighty will not have patience with them, that he may crush their back:</p>
<p>23 And he will repay vengeance to the Gentiles, till he have taken away the multitude of the proud, and broken the sceptres of the unjust,</p>
<p>24 Till he have rendered to men according to their deeds: and according to the works of Adam, and according to his presumption,</p>
<p>25 Till he have judged the cause of his people, and he shall delight the just with his mercy.</p>
<p>26 The mercy of God is beautiful in the time of affliction, as a cloud of rain in the time of drought.</p>
