<article>
<p>1 The sluggard is pelted with a dirty stone, and all men will speak of his disgrace.</p>
<p>2 The sluggard is pelted with the dung of oxen: and every one that toucheth him will shake his hands.</p>
<p>3 A son ill taught is the confusion of the father: and a foolish daughter shall be to his loss.</p>
<p>4 A wise daughter shall bring an inheritance to her husband: but she that confoundeth, becometh a disgrace to her father.</p>
<p>5 She that is bold shameth both her father and husband, and will not be inferior to the ungodly: and shall be disgraced by them both.</p>
<p>6 A tale out of time is like music in mourning: but the stripes and instruction of wisdom are never out of time.</p>
<p>7 He that teacheth a fool, is like one that glueth a potsherd together.</p>
<p>8 He that telleth a word to him that heareth not, is like one that waketh a man out of a deep sleep.</p>
<p>9 He speaketh with one that is asleep, who uttereth wisdom to a fool: and in the end of the discourse he saith: Who is this?</p>
<p>10 Weep for the dead, for his light hath failed: and weep for the fool, for his understanding faileth.</p>
<p>11 Weep but a little for the dead, for he is at rest.</p>
<p>12 For the wicked life of a wicked fool is worse than death.</p>
<p>13 The mourning for the dead is seven days: but for a fool and an ungodly man all the days of their life.</p>
<p>14 Talk not much with a fool and go not with him that hath no sense.</p>
<p>15 Keep thyself from him, that thou mayst not have trouble, and thou shalt not be defiled with his sin.</p>
<p>16 Turn away from him, and thou shalt find rest, and shalt not be wearied out with his folly.</p>
<p>17 What is heavier than lead? and what other name hath he but fool?</p>
<p>18 Sand and salt, and a mass of iron is easier to bear, than a man without sense, that is both foolish and wicked.</p>
<p>19 A frame of wood bound together in the foundation of a building, shall not be loosed: so neither shall the heart that is established by advised counsel.</p>
<p>20 The thought of him that is wise at all times, shall not be depraved by fear.</p>
<p>21 As pales set in high places, and plasterings made without cost, will not stand against the face of the wind:</p>
<p>22 So also a fearful heart in the imagination of a fool shall not resist against the violence of fear.</p>
<p>23 As a fearful heart in the thought of a fool at all times will not fear, so neither shall he that continueth always in the commandments of God.</p>
<p>24 He that pricketh the eye, bringeth out tears: and he that pricketh the heart, bringeth forth resentment.</p>
<p>25 He that flingeth a stone at birds, shall drive them away: so he that upbraideth his friend, breaketh friendship.</p>
<p>26 Although thou hast drawn a sword at a friend, despair not: for there may be a returning. To a friend,</p>
<p>27 If thou hast opened a sad mouth, fear not, for there may be a reconciliation: except upbraiding, and reproach, and pride, and disclosing of secrets, or a treacherous wound: for in all these cases a friend will flee away.</p>
<p>28 Keep fidelity with a friend in his poverty, that in his prosperity also thou mayst rejoice.</p>
<p>29 In the time of his trouble continue faithful to him, that thou mayst also be heir with him in his inheritance.</p>
<p>30 As the vapour of a chimney, and the smoke of the fire goeth up before the fire: so also injurious words, and reproaches, and threats, before blood.</p>
<p>31 I will not be ashamed to salute a friend, neither will I hide myself from his face: and if any evil happen to me by him, I will bear it.</p>
<p>32 But every one that shall hear it, will beware of him.</p>
<p>33 Who will set a guard before my mouth, and a sure seal upon my lips, that I fall not by them, and that my tongue destroy me not?</p>
