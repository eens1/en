<article>
<p>1 Happy is the husband of a good wife: for the number of his years is double.</p>
<p>2 A virtuous woman rejoiceth her husband, and shall fulfil the years of his life in peace.</p>
<p>3 A good wife is a good portion, she shall be given in the portion of them that fear God, to a man for his good deeds.</p>
<p>4 Rich or poor, if his heart is good, his countenance shall be cheerful at all times.</p>
<p>5 Of three things my heart hath been afraid, and at the fourth my face hath trembled:</p>
<p>6 The accusation of a city, and the gathering together of the people:</p>
<p>7 And a false calumny, all are more grievous than death.</p>
<p>8 A jealous woman is the grief and mourning of the heart.</p>
<p>9 With a jealous woman is a scourge of the tongue which communicateth with all.</p>
<p>10 As a yoke of oxen that is moved to and fro, so also is a wicked woman: he that hath hold of her, is as he that taketh hold of a scorpion.</p>
<p>11 A drunken woman is a great wrath: and her reproach and shame shall not be hid.</p>
<p>12 The fornication of a woman shall be known by the haughtiness of her eyes and by her eyelids.</p>
<p>13 On a daughter that turneth not away herself, set a strict watch: lest finding an opportunity she abuse herself.</p>
<p>14 Take heed of the impudence of her eyes, and wonder not if she slight thee.</p>
<p>15 She will open her mouth as a thirsty traveller to the fountain, and will drink of every water near her, and will sit down by every hedge, and open her quiver against every arrow, until she fail.</p>
<p>16 The grace of a diligent woman shall delight her husband, and shall fat his bones.</p>
<p>17 Her discipline is the gift of God.</p>
<p>18 Such is a wise and silent woman, and there is nothing so much worth as a well instructed soul.</p>
<p>19 A holy and shamefaced woman is grace upon grace.</p>
<p>20 And no price is worthy of a continent soul.</p>
<p>21 As the sun when it riseth to the world in the high places of God, so is the beauty of a good wife for the ornament of her house.</p>
<p>22 As the lamp shining upon the holy candlestick, so is the beauty of the face in a ripe age,</p>
<p>23 As golden pillars upon bases of silver, so are the firm feet upon the soles of a steady woman.</p>
<p>24 As everlasting foundations upon a solid rock, so the commandments of God in the heart of a holy woman.</p>
<p>25 At two things my heart is grieved, and the third bringeth anger upon me.</p>
<p>26 A man of war fainting through poverty, and a man of sense despised:</p>
<p>27 And he that passeth over from justice to sin, God hath prepared such an one for the sword.</p>
<p>28 Two sorts of callings have appeared to me hard and dangerous: a merchant is hardly free from negligence: and a huckster shall not be justified from the sins of the lips.</p>
