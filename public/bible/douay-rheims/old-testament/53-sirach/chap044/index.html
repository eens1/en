<p>1 Let us now praise men of renown and our fathers in their generation.</p>
<p>2 The Lord hath wrought great glory through his magnificence from the beginning.</p>
<p>3 Such as have borne rule in their dominions, men of great power, and endued with their wisdom, shewing forth in the prophets the dignity of prophets,</p>
<p>4 And ruling over the present people, and by the strength of wisdom instructing the people in most holy words.</p>
<p>5 Such as by their skill sought out musical tunes, and published canticles of the scriptures.</p>
<p>6 Rich men in virtue, studying beautifulness: living at peace in their houses.</p>
<p>7 All these have gained glory in their generations, and were praised in their days.</p>
<p>8 They that were born of them have left a name behind them, that their praises might be related:</p>
<p>9 And there are some, of whom there is no memorial: who are perished, as if they had never been: and are become as if they had never been born, and their children with them.</p>
<p>10 But these were men of mercy, whose godly deeds have not failed:</p>
<p>11 Good things continue with their seed,</p>
<p>12 Their posterity are a holy inheritance, and their seed hath stood in the covenants.</p>
<p>13 And their children for their sakes remain for ever: their seed and their glory shall not be forsaken.</p>
<p>14 Their bodies are buried in peace, and their name liveth unto generation and generation.</p>
<p>15 Let the people shew forth their wisdom, and the church declare their praise.</p>
<p>16 Henoch pleased God, and was translated into paradise, that he may give repentance to the nations.</p>
<p>17 Noe was found perfect, just, and in the time of wrath he was made a reconciliation.</p>
<p>18 Therefore was there a remnant left to the earth, when the flood came.</p>
<p>19 The covenants of the world were made with him, that all flesh should no more be destroyed with the flood.</p>
<p>20 Abraham was the great father of a multitude of nations, and there was not found the like to him in glory, who kept the law of the most High, and was in covenant with him.</p>
<p>21 In his flesh he established the covenant, and in temptation he was found faithful.</p>
<p>22 Therefore by an oath he gave him glory in his posterity, that he should increase as the dust of the earth,</p>
<p>23 And that he would exalt his seed as the stars, and they should inherit from sea to sea, and from the river to the ends of the earth.</p>
<p>24 And he did in like manner with Isaac for the sake of Abraham his father.</p>
<p>25 The Lord gave him the blessing of all nations, and confirmed his covenant upon the head of Jacob.</p>
<p>26 He acknowledged him in his blessings, and gave him an inheritance, and divided him his portion in twelve tribes.</p>
<p>27 And he preserved for him men of mercy, that found grace in the eyes of all flesh.</p>
