<p>1 Strive not with a powerful man, lest thou fall into his hands.</p>
<p>2 Contend not with a rich man, lest he bring an action against thee.</p>
<p>3 For gold and silver hath destroyed many, and hath reached even to the heart of kings, and perverted them.</p>
<p>4 Strive not with a man that is full of tongue, and heap not wood upon his fire.</p>
<p>5 Communicate not with an ignorant man, lest he speak ill of thy family.</p>
<p>6 Despise not a man that turneth away from sin, nor reproach him therewith: remember that we are all worthy of reproof.</p>
<p>7 Despise not a man in his old age; for we also shall become old.</p>
<p>8 Rejoice not at the death of thy enemy; knowing that we all die, and are not willing that others should rejoice at our death.</p>
<p>9 Despise not the discourse of them that are ancient and wise, but acquaint thyself with their proverbs.</p>
<p>10 For of them thou shalt learn wisdom, and instruction of understanding, and to serve great men without blame.</p>
<p>11 Let not the discourse of the ancients escape thee, for they have learned of their fathers:</p>
<p>12 For of them thou shalt learn understanding, and to give an answer in time of need.</p>
<p>13 Kindle not the coals of sinners by rebuking them, lest thou be burnt with the flame of the fire of their sins.</p>
<p>14 Stand not against the face of an injurious person, lest he sit as a spy to entrap thee in thy words.</p>
<p>15 Lend not to a man that is mightier than thyself: and if thou lendest, count it as lost.</p>
<p>16 Be not surety above thy power: and if thou be surety, think as if thou wert to pay it.</p>
<p>17 Judge not against a judge: for he judgeth according to that which is just.</p>
<p>18 Go not on the way with a bold man, lest he burden thee with his evils: for he goeth according to his own will, and thou shalt perish together with his folly.</p>
<p>19 Quarrel not with a passionate man, and go not into the desert with a bold man: for blood is as nothing in his sight, and where there is no help he will overthrow thee.</p>
<p>20 Advise not with fools, for they cannot love but such things as please them.</p>
<p>21 Before a stranger do no matter of counsel: for thou knowest not what he will bring forth.</p>
<p>22 Open not thy heart to every man: lest he repay thee with an evil turn, and speak reproachfully to thee.</p>
