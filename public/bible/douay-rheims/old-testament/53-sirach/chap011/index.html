<p>1 The wisdom of the humble shall exalt his head, and shall make him sit in the midst of great men.</p>
<p>2 Praise not a man for his beauty, neither despise a man for his look.</p>
<p>3 The bee is small among flying things but her fruit hath the chiefest sweetness.</p>
<p>4 Glory not in apparel at any time, and be not exalted in the day of thy honour: for the works of the Highest only are wonderful, and his works are glorious, and secret, and hidden.</p>
<p>5 Many tyrants have sat on the throne, and he whom no man would think on, hath worn the crown.</p>
<p>6 Many mighty men have been greatly brought down, and the glorious have been delivered into the hand of others.</p>
<p>7 Before thou inquire, blame no man: and when thou hast inquired, reprove justly.</p>
<p>8 Before thou hear, answer not a word: and interrupt not others in the midst of their discourse.</p>
<p>9 Strive not in a matter which doth not concern thee, and sit not in judgment with sinners.</p>
<p>10 My son, meddle not with many matters: and if thou be rich, thou shalt not be free from sin: for if thou pursue after thou shalt not overtake; and if thou run before thou shalt not escape.</p>
<p>11 There is an ungodly man that laboureth, and maketh haste, and is in sorrow, and is so much the more in want.</p>
<p>12 Again, there is an inactive man that wanteth help, is very weak in ability, and full of poverty:</p>
<p>13 Yet the eye of God hath looked upon him for good, and hath lifted him up from his low estate, and hath exalted his head: and many have wondered at him, and have glorified God.</p>
<p>14 Good things and evil, life and death, poverty and riches, are from God.</p>
<p>15 Wisdom and discipline, and the knowledge of the law are with God. Love and the ways of good things are with him.</p>
<p>16 Error and darkness are created with sinners: and they that glory in evil things, grow old in evil.</p>
<p>17 The gift of God abideth with the just, and his advancement shall have success for ever.</p>
<p>18 There is one that is enriched by living sparingly, and this is the portion of his reward.</p>
<p>19 In that he saith: I have found me rest, and now I will eat of my goods alone:</p>
<p>20 And he knoweth not what time shall pass, and that death approacheth, and that he must leave all to others, and shall die.</p>
<p>21 Be steadfast in thy covenant, and be conversant therein, and grow old in the work of thy commandments.</p>
<p>22 Abide not in the works of sinners. But trust in God, and stay in thy place,</p>
<p>23 For it is easy in the eyes of God on a sudden to make the poor man rich.</p>
<p>24 The blessing of God maketh haste to reward the just, and in a swift hour his blessing beareth fruit.</p>
<p>25 Say not: What need I, and what good shall I have by this?</p>
<p>26 Say not: I am sufficient for myself: and what shall I be made worse by this?</p>
<p>27 In the day of good things be not unmindful of evils: and in the day of evils be not unmindful of good things:</p>
<p>28 For it is easy before God in the day of death to reward every one according to his ways.</p>
<p>29 The affliction of an hour maketh one forget great delights, and in the end of a man is the disclosing of his works.</p>
<p>30 Praise not any man before death, for a man is known by his children.</p>
<p>31 Bring not every man into thy house: for many are the snares of the deceitful.</p>
<p>32 For as corrupted bowels send forth stinking breath, and as the partridge is brought into the cage, and as the roe into the snare: so also is the heart of the proud, and as a spy that looketh on the fall of his neighbour.</p>
<p>33 For he lieth in wait and turneth good into evil, and on the elect he will lay a blot.</p>
<p>34 Of one spark cometh a great fire, and of one deceitful man much blood: and a sinful man lieth in wait for blood.</p>
<p>35 Take heed to thyself of a mischievous man, for he worketh evils: lest he bring upon thee reproach for ever.</p>
<p>36 Receive a stranger in, and he shall overthrow thee with a whirlwind, and shall turn thee out of thy own.</p>
