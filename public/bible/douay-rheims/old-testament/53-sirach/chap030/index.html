<article>
<p>1 He that loveth his son, frequently chastiseth him, that he may rejoice in his latter end, and not grope after the doors of his neighbours.</p>
<p>2 He that instructeth his son shall be praised in him, and shall glory in him in the midst of them of his household.</p>
<p>3 He that teacheth his son, maketh his enemy jealous, and in the midst of his friends he shall glory in him.</p>
<p>4 His father is dead, and he is as if he were not dead: for he hath left one behind him that is like himself.</p>
<p>5 While he lived he saw and rejoiced in him: and when he died he was not sorrowful, neither was he confounded before his enemies.</p>
<p>6 For he left behind him a defender of his house against his enemies, and one that will requite kindness to his friends.</p>
<p>7 For the souls of his sons he shall bind up his wounds, and at every cry his bowels shall be troubled.</p>
<p>8 A horse not broken becometh stubborn, and a child left to himself will become headstrong.</p>
<p>9 Give thy son his way, and he shall make thee afraid: play with him, and he shall make thee sorrowful.</p>
<p>10 Laugh not with him, lest thou have sorrow, and at the last thy teeth be set on edge.</p>
<p>11 Give him not liberty in his youth, and wink not at his devices.</p>
<p>12 Bow down his neck while he is young, and beat his sides while he is a child, lest he grow stubborn, and regard thee not, and so be a sorrow of heart to thee.</p>
<p>13 Instruct thy son, and labour about him, lest his lewd behaviour be an offence to thee.</p>
<p>14 Better is a poor man who is sound, and strong of constitution, than a rich man who is weak and afflicted with evils.</p>
<p>15 Health of the soul in holiness of justice, is better than all gold and silver: and a sound body, than immense revenues.</p>
<p>16 There is no riches above the riches of the health of the body: and there is no pleasure above the joy of the heart.</p>
<p>17 Better is death than a bitter life, and everlasting rest, than continual sickness.</p>
<p>18 Good things that are hidden in a mouth that is shut, are as messes of meat set about a grave.</p>
<p>19 What good shall an offering do to an idol? for it can neither eat, nor smell:</p>
<p>20 So is he that is persecuted by the Lord, bearing the reward of his iniquity:</p>
<p>21 He seeth with his eyes, and groaneth, as an eunuch embracing a virgin, and sighing.</p>
<p>22 Give not up thy soul to sadness, and afflict not thyself in thy own counsel.</p>
<p>23 The joyfulness of the heart, is the life of a man, and a never failing treasure of holiness: and the joy of a man is length of life.</p>
<p>24 Have pity on thy own soul, pleasing God, and contain thyself: gather up thy heart in his holiness: and drive away sadness far from thee.</p>
<p>25 For sadness hath killed many, and there is no profit in it.</p>
<p>26 Envy and anger shorten a man&rsquo;s days, and pensiveness will bring old age before the time.</p>
<p>27 A cheerful and good heart is always feasting: for his banquets are prepared with diligence.</p>
