<p>1 And Jonah was exceedingly troubled, and was angry:</p>
<p>2 And he prayed to the Lord, and said: I beseech thee, O Lord, is not this what I said, when I was yet in my own country? therefore I went before to flee into Tharsis: for I know that thou art a gracious and merciful God, patient, and of much compassion, and easy to forgive evil.</p>
<p>3 And now, O Lord, I beseech thee take my life from me: for it is better for me to die than to live.</p>
<p>4 And the Lord said: Dost thou think thou hast reason to be angry?</p>
<p>5 Then Jonah went out of the city, and sat toward the east side of the city: and he made himself a booth there, and he sat under it in the shadow, till he might see what would befall the city.</p>
<p>6 And the Lord God prepared an ivy, and it came up over the head of Jonah, to be a shadow over his head, and to cover him (for he was fatigued): and Jonah was exceeding glad of the ivy.</p>
<p>7 But God prepared a worm, when the morning arose on the following day: and it struck the ivy and it withered.</p>
<p>8 And when the sun was risen, the Lord commanded a hot and burning wind: and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, and he broiled with the heat: and he desired for his soul that he might die, and said: It is better for me to die than to live.</p>
<p>9 And the Lord said to Jonah: Dost thou think thou hast reason to be angry, for the ivy? And he said: I am angry with reason even unto death.</p>
<p>10 And the Lord said: Thou art grieved for the ivy, for which thou hast not laboured, nor made it to grow, which in one night came up, and in one night perished.</p>
<p>11 And shall I not spare Ninive, that great city, in which there are more than a hundred and twenty thousand persons, that know how to distinguish between their right hand and their left, and many beasts?</p>
