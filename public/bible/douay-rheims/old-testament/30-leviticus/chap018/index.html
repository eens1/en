<article>
<p>1 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>
<p>2 Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them: I am the Lord your God.</p>
<p>3 You shall not do according to the custom of the land of Egypt, in which you dwelt: neither shall you act according to the manner of the country of Chanaan, into which I will bring you. Nor shall you walk in their ordinances.</p>
<p>4 You shall do my judgments, and shall observe my precepts, and shall walk in them. I am the Lord your God.</p>
<p>5 Keep my laws and my judgments: which if a man do, he shall live in them, I am the Lord.</p>
<p>6 No man shall approach to her that is near of kin to him, to uncover her nakedness. I am the Lord.</p>
<p>7 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father, or the nakedness of thy mother: she is thy mother, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.</p>
<p>8 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father&rsquo;s wife: for it is the nakedness of thy father.</p>
<p>9 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy sister by father or by mother: whether born at home or abroad.</p>
<p>10 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy son&rsquo;s daughter, or thy daughter&rsquo;s daughter: because it is thy own nakedness.</p>
<p>11 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s daughter, whom she bore to thy father: and who is thy sister.</p>
<p>12 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father&rsquo;s sister: because she is the flesh of thy father.</p>
<p>13 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother&rsquo;s sister: because she is thy mother&rsquo;s flesh.</p>
<p>14 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father&rsquo;s brother: neither shalt thou approach to his wife, who is joined to thee by affinity.</p>
<p>15 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter in law: because she is thy son&rsquo;s wife, neither shalt thou discover her shame.</p>
<p>16 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother&rsquo;s wife: because it is the nakedness of thy brother.</p>
<p>17 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy wife and her daughter. Thou shalt not take her son&rsquo;s daughter or her daughter&rsquo;s daughter, to discover her shame: because they are her flesh, and such copulation is incest.</p>
<p>18 Thou shalt not take thy wife&rsquo;s sister for a harlot, to rival her: neither shalt thou discover her nakedness, while she is yet living.</p>
<p>19 Thou shalt not approach to a woman having her flowers: neither shalt thou uncover her nakedness.</p>
<p>20 Thou shalt not lie with thy neighbour&rsquo;s wife: nor be defiled with mingling of seed.</p>
<p>21 Thou shalt not give any of thy seed to be consecrated to the idol Moloch, nor defile the name of thy God. I am the Lord.</p>
<p>22 Thou shalt not lie with mankind as with womankind: because it is an abomination.</p>
<p>23 Thou shalt not copulate with any beast: neither shalt thou be defiled with it. A woman shall not lie down to a beast, nor copulate with it: because it is a heinous crime.</p>
<p>24 Defile not yourselves with any of these things with which all the nations have been defiled, which I will cast out before you,</p>
<p>25 And with which the land is defiled: the abominations of which I will visit, that it may vomit out its inhabitants.</p>
<p>26 Keep ye my ordinances and my judgments: and do not any of these abominations. Neither any of your own nation, nor any stranger that sojourneth among you.</p>
<p>27 For all these detestable things the inhabitants of the land have done, that were before you, and have defiled it.</p>
<p>28 Beware then, lest in like manner, it vomit you also out, if you do the like things: as it vomited out the nation that was before you.</p>
<p>29 Every soul that shall commit any of these abominations, shall perish from the midst of his people.</p>
<p>30 Keep my commandments. Do not the things which they have done, that have been before you: and be not defiled therein. I am the Lord your God.</p>
