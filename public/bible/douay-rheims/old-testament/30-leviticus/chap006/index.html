<p>1 The Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>
<p>2 Whosoever shall sin, and despising the Lord, shall deny to his neighbour the thing delivered to his keeping, which was committed to his trust; or shall by force extort any thing, or commit oppression;</p>
<p>3 Or shall find a thing lost, and denying it, shall also swear falsely, or shall do any other of the many things, wherein men are wont to sin:</p>
<p>4 Being convicted of the offence, he shall restore</p>
<p>5 All that he would have gotten by fraud, in the principal, and the fifth part besides, to the owner, whom he wronged.</p>
<p>6 Moreover for his sin he shall offer a ram without blemish out of the flock: and shall give it to the priest, according to the estimation and measure of the offence.</p>
<p>7 And he shall pray for him before the Lord: and he shall have forgiveness for every thing in doing of which he bath sinned.</p>
<p>8 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>
<p>9 Command Aaron and his sons: This is the law of a holocaust. It shall be burnt upon the altar, all night until morning: the fire shall be of the same altar.</p>
<p>10 The priest shall be vested with the tunick and the linen breeches; and he shall take up the ashes of that which the devouring fire hath burnt: and putting them beside the altar,</p>
<p>11 Shall put off his former vestments, and being clothed with others, shall carry them forth without the camp, and shall cause them to be consumed to dust in a very clean place.</p>
<p>12 And the fire on the altar shall always burn, and the priest shall feed it, putting wood on it every day in the morning: and laying on the holocaust, shall burn thereupon the fat of the peace offerings.</p>
<p>13 This is the perpetual fire which shall never go out on the altar.</p>
<p>14 This is the law of the sacrifice and libations, which the children of Aaron shall offer before the Lord, and before the altar.</p>
<p>15 The priest shall take a handful of the flour that is tempered with oil, and all the frankincense that is put upon the flour: and he shall burn on the altar for a memorial of most sweet odour to the Lord.</p>
<p>16 And the part of the flour that is left, Aaron and his sons shall eat, without leaven: and he shall eat it in the holy place of the court of the tabernacle.</p>
<p>17 And therefore it shall not be leavened, because part thereof is offered for the burnt sacrifice of the Lord. It shall be most holy, as that which is offered for sin and for trespass.</p>
<p>18 The males only of the race of Aaron shall eat it. It shall be an ordinance everlasting in your generations concerning the sacrifices of the Lord: Every one that toucheth them shall be sanctified.</p>
<p>19 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>
<p>20 This is the oblation of Aaron, and of his sons, which they must offer to the Lord, in the day of their anointing. They shall offer the tenth part of an ephi of flour for a perpetual sacrifice, half of it in the morning, and half of it in the evening.</p>
<p>21 It shall be tempered with oil, and shall be fried in a fryingpan.</p>
<p>22 And the priest that rightfully succeedeth his father, shall offer it hot, for a most sweet odour to the Lord: and it shall he wholly burnt on the altar.</p>
<p>23 For every sacrifice of the priest shall be consumed with fire: neither shall any man eat thereof.</p>
<p>24 And the Lord spoke to Moses. saying:</p>
<p>25 Say to Aaron and his sons: This is the law of the victim for sin. In the place where the holocaust is offered, it shall be immolated before the Lord. It is holy of holies.</p>
<p>26 The priest that offereth it, shall eat it in a holy place, in the court of the tabernacle.</p>
<p>27 Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof, shall be sanctified. If a garment be sprinkled with the blood thereof, it shall be washed in a holy place.</p>
<p>28 And the earthen vessel, wherein it was sodden, shall be broken: but if the vessel be of brass, it shall be scoured, and washed with water.</p>
<p>29 Every male of the priestly race shall eat of the flesh thereof, because it is holy of holies.</p>
<p>30 For the victim that is slain for sin, the blood of which is carried into the tabernacle of the testimony to make atonement in the sanctuary, shall not be eaten, but shall be burnt with fire.</p>
