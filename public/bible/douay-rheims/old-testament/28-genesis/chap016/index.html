<h1>Chapter 16</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Now Sarai, the wife of Abram, had brought forth no children: but having a handmaid, an Egyptian, named Agar,</p>
<p>2 She said to her husband: Behold, the Lord hath restrained me from bearing: go in unto my handmaid, it may be I may have children of her at least. And when he agreed to her request,</p>
<p>3 She took Agar the Egyptian her handmaid, ten years after they first dwelt in the land of Chanaan, and gave her to her husband to wife.</p>
<p>4 And he went in to her. But she perceiving that she was with child, despised her mistress.</p>
<p>5 And Sarai said to Abram: Thou dost unjustly with me: I gave my handmaid into thy bosom, and she perceiving herself to be with child, despiseth me. The Lord judge between me and thee.</p>
<p>6 And Abram made answer, and said to her: Behold thy handmaid is in thy own hand, use her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai afflicted her, she ran away.</p>
<p>7 And the angel of the Lord having found her, by a fountain of water in the wilderness, which is in the way to Sur in the desert,</p>
<p>8 He said to her: Agar, handmaid of Sarai, whence comest thou? and whither goest thou? And she answered: I flee from the face of Sarai, my mistress.</p>
<p>9 And the angel of the Lord said to her: Return to thy mistress, and humble thyself under her hand.</p>
<p>10 And again he said: I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, and it shall not be numbered for multitude.</p>
<p>11 And again: Behold, said he, thou art with child, and thou shalt bring forth a son: and thou shalt call his name Ismael, because the Lord hath heard thy affliction.</p>
<p>12 He shall be a wild man: his hand will be against all men, and all men&rsquo;s hands against him: and he shall pitch his tents over against all his brethren.</p>
<p>13 And she called the name of the Lord that spoke unto her: Thou the God who hast seen me. For she said: Verily, here have I seen the hinder parts of him that seeth me.</p>
<p>14 Therefore she called that well, the well of him that liveth and seeth me. The same is between Cades and Barad.</p>
<p>15 And Agar brought forth a son to Abram: who called his name Ismael.</p>
<p>16 Abram was four score and six years old when Agar brought him forth Ismael.</p>
