<article>
<p>1 And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, saying: Take not a wife of the stock of Chanaan:</p>
<p>2 But go, and take a journey to Mesopotamia of Syria, to the house of Bathuel, thy mother&rsquo;s father, and take thee a wife thence of the daughters of Laban, thy uncle.</p>
<p>3 And God almighty bless thee, and make thee to increase and multiply thee: that thou mayst be a multitude of people.</p>
<p>4 And give the blessings of Abraham to thee, and to thy seed after thee: that thou mayst possess the land of thy sojournment, which he promised to thy grandfather.</p>
<p>5 And when Isaac had sent him away, he took his journey and went to Mesopotamia of Syria, to Laban, the son of Bathuel, the Syrian, brother to Rebecca, his mother.</p>
<p>6 And Esau seeing that his father had blessed Jacob, and had sent him into Mesopotamia of Syria, to marry a wife thence; and that after the blessing he had charged him, saying: Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Chanaan:</p>
<p>7 And that Jacob obeying his parents, was gone into Syria:</p>
<p>8 Experiencing also, that his father was not well pleased with the daughters of Chanaan:</p>
<p>9 He went to Ismael, and took to wife, besides them he had before, Maheleth, the daughter of Ismael, Abraham&rsquo;s son, the sister of Nabajoth.</p>
<p>10 But Jacob being departed from Bersabee, went on to Haran.</p>
<p>11 And when he was come to a certain place, and would rest in it after sunset, he took of the stones that lay there, and putting under his head, slept in the same place.</p>
<p>12 And he saw in his sleep a ladder standing upon the earth, and the top thereof touching heaven: the angels also of God ascending and descending by it.</p>
<p>13 And the Lord leaning upon the ladder saying to him: I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: The land, wherein thou sleepest, I will give to thee and to thy seed.</p>
<p>14 And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth: thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and IN THEE and thy seed, all the tribes of the earth SHALL BE BLESSED.</p>
<p>15 And I will be thy keeper whithersoever thou goest, and will bring thee back into this land: neither will I leave thee, till I shall have accomplished all that I have said.</p>
<p>16 And when Jacob awaked out of sleep, he said: Indeed the Lord is in this place, and I knew it not.</p>
<p>17 And trembling, he said: How terrible is this place? this is no other but the house of God, and the gate of heaven.</p>
<p>18 And Jacob arising in the morning, took the stone which he had laid under his head, and set it up for a title, pouring oil upon the top of it.</p>
<p>19 And he called the name of the city Bethel, which before was called Luza.</p>
<p>20 And he made a vow, saying: If God shall be with me, and shall keep me in the way, by which I walk, and shall give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,</p>
<p>21 And I shall return prosperously to my father&rsquo;s house: the Lord shall be my God:</p>
<p>22 And this stone, which I have set up for a title, shall be called the house of God: and of all things that thou shalt give to me, I will offer tithes to thee.</p>
