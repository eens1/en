<h1>Chapter 21</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 And the Lord visited Sara, as he had promised: and fulfilled what he had spoken.</p>
<p>2 And she conceived and bore a son in her old age, at the time that God had foretold her.</p>
<p>3 And Abraham called the name of his son, whom Sara bore him, Isaac.</p>
<p>4 And he circumcised him the eighth day, as God had commanded him,</p>
<p>5 When he was a hundred years old: for at this age of his father, was Isaac born.</p>
<p>6 And Sara said: God hath made a laughter for me: whosoever shall hear of it will laugh with me.</p>
<p>7 And again she said: Who would believe that Abraham should hear that Sara gave suck to a son, whom she bore to him in his old age?</p>
<p>8 And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast on the day of his weaning.</p>
<p>9 And when Sara had seen the son of Agar, the Egyptian, playing with Isaac, her son, she said to Abraham:</p>
<p>10 Cast out this bondwoman and her son; for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with my son Isaac.</p>
<p>11 Abraham took this grievously for his son.</p>
<p>12 And God said to him: Let it not seem grievous to thee for the boy, and for thy bondwoman: in all that Sara hath said to thee, hearken to her voice: for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.</p>
<p>13 But I will make the son also of the bondwoman a great nation, because he is thy seed.</p>
<p>14 So Abraham rose up in the morning, and taking bread and a bottle of water, put it upon her shoulder, and delivered the boy, and sent her away. And she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Bersabee.</p>
<p>15 And when the water in the bottle was spent, she cast the boy under one of the trees that were there.</p>
<p>16 And she went her way, and sat over against him a great way off, as far as a bow can carry, for she said: I will not see the boy die: and sitting over against, she lifted up her voice and wept.</p>
<p>17 And God heard the voice of the boy: and an angel of God called to Agar from heaven, saying: What art thou doing, Agar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the boy, from the place wherein he is.</p>
<p>18 Arise, take up the boy, and hold him by the hand, for I will make him a great nation.</p>
<p>19 And God opened her eyes: and she saw a well of water, and went and filled the bottle, and gave the boy to drink.</p>
<p>20 And God was with him: and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became a young man, an archer.</p>
<p>21 And he dwelt in the wilderness of Pharan, and his mother took a wife for him out of the land of Egypt.</p>
<p>22 At the same time Abimelech, and Phicol the general of his army, said to Abraham: God is with thee in all that thou dost.</p>
<p>23 Swear therefore by God, that thou wilt not hurt me, nor my posterity, nor my stock: but according to the kindness that I have done to thee, thou shalt do to me, and to the land wherein thou hast lived a stranger.</p>
<p>24 And Abraham said: I will swear.</p>
<p>25 And he reproved Abimelech for a well of water, which his servants had taken away by force.</p>
<p>26 And Abimelech answered: I knew not who did this thing: and thou didst not tell me, and I heard not of it till today.</p>
<p>27 Then Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them to Abimelech: and both of them made a league.</p>
<p>28 And Abraham set apart seven ewelambs of the flock.</p>
<p>29 And Abimelech said to him: What mean these seven ewelambs which thou hast set apart?</p>
<p>30 But he said: Thou shalt take seven ewelambs at my hand: that they may be a testimony for me, that I dug this well.</p>
<p>31 Therefore that place was called Bersabee; because there both of them did swear.</p>
<p>32 And they made a league for the well of oath.</p>
<p>33 And Abimelech and Phicol, the general of his army, arose and returned to the land of the Palestines. But Abraham planted a grove in Bersabee, and there called upon the name of the Lord God eternal.</p>
<p>34 And he was a sojourner in the land of the Palestines many days.</p>
