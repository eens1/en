<h1>Chapter 20</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Abraham removed from thence to the south country, and dwelt between Cades and Sur, and sojourned in Gerara.</p>
<p>2 And he said of Sara his wife: She is my sister. So Abimelech the king of Gerara sent, and took her.</p>
<p>3 And God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and he said to him: Lo thou shalt die for the woman that thou hast taken: for she hath a husband.</p>
<p>4 Now Abimelech had not touched her, and he said: Lord, wilt thou slay a nation that is ignorant and just?</p>
<p>5 Did not he say to me: She is my sister: and she say, He is my brother? in the simplicity of my heart, and cleanness of my hands have I done this.</p>
<p>6 And God said to him: And I know that thou didst it with a sincere heart: and therefore I withheld thee from sinning against me, and I suffered thee not to touch her.</p>
<p>7 Now therefore restore the man his wife, for he is a prophet: and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: but if thou wilt not restore her, know that thou shalt surely die, thou and all that are thine.</p>
<p>8 And Abimelech forthwith rising up in the night, called all his servants: and spoke all these words in their hearing, and all the men were exceedingly afraid.</p>
<p>9 And Abimelech called also for Abraham, and said to him: What hast thou done to us? what have we offended thee in, that thou hast brought upon me and upon my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done to us what thou oughtest not to do.</p>
<p>10 And again he expostulated with him, and said: What sawest thou, that thou hast done this?</p>
<p>11 Abraham answered: I thought with myself, saying: Perhaps there is not the fear of God in this place: and they will kill me for the sake of my wife:</p>
<p>12 Howbeit, otherwise also she is truly my sister, the daughter of my father, and not the daughter of my mother, and I took her to wife.</p>
<p>13 And after God brought me out of my father&rsquo;s house, I said to her: Thou shalt do me this kindness: In every place, to which we shall come, thou shalt say that I am thy brother.</p>
<p>14 And Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and servants and handmaids, and gave to Abraham: and restored to him Sara his wife,</p>
<p>15 And said: The land is before you, dwell wheresoever it shall please thee.</p>
<p>16 And to Sara he said: Behold I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver, this shall serve thee for a covering of thy eyes to all that are with thee, and whithersoever thou shalt go: and remember thou wast taken.</p>
<p>17 And when Abraham prayed, God healed Abimelech and his wife, and his handmaids, and they bore children:</p>
<p>18 For the Lord had closed up every womb of the house of Abimelech, on account of Sara, Abraham&rsquo;s wife.</p>
