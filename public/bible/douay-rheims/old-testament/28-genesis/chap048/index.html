<p>1 After these things, it was told Joseph that his father was sick; and he set out to go to him, taking his two sons Manasses and Ephraim.</p>
<p>2 And it was told the old man: Behold thy son Joseph cometh to thee. And being strengthened, he sat on his bed.</p>
<p>3 And when Joseph was come in to him, he said: God almighty appeared to me at Luza, which is in the land of Chanaan, and he blessed me,</p>
<p>4 And said: I will cause thee to increase and multiply, and I will make of thee a multitude of people: and I will give this land to thee, and to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession.</p>
<p>5 So thy two sons, who were born to thee in the land of Egypt before I came hither to thee, shall be mine: Ephraim and Manasses shall be reputed to me as Ruben and Simeon.</p>
<p>6 But the rest whom thou shalt have after them, shall be thine, and shall be called by the name of their brethren in their possessions.</p>
<p>7 For, when I came out of Mesopotamia, Rachel died from me in the land of Chanaan in the very journey, and it was spring time: and I was going to Ephrata, and I buried her near the way of Ephrata, which by another name is called Bethlehem.</p>
<p>8 Then seeing his sons, he said to him: Who are these?</p>
<p>9 He answered: They are my sons, whom God hath given me in this place. And he said: Bring them to me, that I may bless them.</p>
<p>10 For Israel&rsquo;s eyes were dim by reason of his great age, and he could not see clearly. And when they were brought to him, he kissed and embraced them,</p>
<p>11 And said to his son: I am not deprived of seeing thee; moreover God hath shewn me thy seed.</p>
<p>12 And when Joseph had taken them from his father&rsquo;s lap, he bowed down with his face to the ground.</p>
<p>13 And he set Ephraim on his right hand, that is, towards the left hand of Israel; but Manasses on his left hand, to wit, towards his father&rsquo;s right hand, and brought them near to him.</p>
<p>14 But he, stretching forth his right hand, put it upon the head of Ephraim, the younger brother; and the left upon the head of Manasses, who was the elder, changing his hands.</p>
<p>15 And Jacob blessed the sons of Joseph, and said: God, in whose sight my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, God that feedeth me from my youth until this day:</p>
<p>16 The angel that delivereth me from all evils, bless these boys: and let my name be called upon them, and the names of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and may they grow into a multitude upon the earth.</p>
<p>17 And Joseph seeing that his father had put his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, was much displeased: and taking his father&rsquo;s hand, he tried to lift it from Ephraim&rsquo;s head, and to remove it to the head of Manasses.</p>
<p>18 And he said to his father: It should not be so, my father; for this is the firstborn, put thy right hand upon his head.</p>
<p>19 But he refusing, said: I know, my son, I know: and this also shall become a people, and shall be multiplied; but his younger brother shall be greater than he; and his seed shall grow into nations.</p>
<p>20 And he blessed them at that time, saying: In thee shall Israel be blessed, and it shall be said: God do to thee as to Ephraim, and as to Manasses. And he set Ephraim before Manasses.</p>
<p>21 And he said to Joseph, his son: Behold I die, and God will be with you, and will bring you back into the land of your fathers.</p>
<p>22 I give thee a portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorrhite with my sword and bow.</p>
