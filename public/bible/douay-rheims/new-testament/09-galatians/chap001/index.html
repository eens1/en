<article>
<p>1 Paul, an apostle, not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead:</p>
<p>2 And all the brethren who are with me: to the churches of Galatia.</p>
<p>3 Grace be to you, and peace from God the Father and from our Lord Jesus Christ,</p>
<p>4 Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present wicked world, according to the will of God and our Father:</p>
<p>5 To whom is glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p>6 I wonder that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ, unto another gospel.</p>
<p>7 Which is not another: only there are some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of Christ.</p>
<p>8 But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach a gospel to you besides that which we have preached to you, let him be anathema.</p>
<p>9 As we said before, so now I say again: If any one preach to you a gospel, besides that which you have received, let him be anathema.</p>
<p>10 For do I now persuade men, or God? Or do I seek to please men? If I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.</p>
<p>11 For I give you to understand, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man.</p>
<p>12 For neither did I receive it of man: nor did I learn it but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>13 For you have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews&rsquo; religion: how that, beyond measure, I persecuted the church of God and wasted it.</p>
<p>14 And I made progress in the Jew&rsquo;s religion above many of my equals in my own nation, being more abundantly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.</p>
<p>15 But when it pleased him who separated me from my mother&rsquo;s womb and called me by his grace,</p>
<p>16 To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles: immediately I condescended not to flesh and blood.</p>
<p>17 Neither went I to Jerusalem, to the apostles who were before me: but I went into Arabia, and again I returned to Damascus.</p>
<p>18 Then, after three years, I went to Jerusalem to see Peter: and I tarried with him fifteen days.</p>
<p>19 But other of the apostles I saw none, saving James the brother of the Lord.</p>
<p>20 Now the things which I write to you, behold, before God, I lie not.</p>
<p>21 Afterwards, I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.</p>
<p>22 And I was unknown by face to the churches of Judea, which were in Christ:</p>
<p>23 But they had heard only: He, who persecuted us in times past doth now preach the faith which once he impugned.</p>
<p>24 And they glorified God in me.</p>
