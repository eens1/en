<h1>Chapter 5</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Stand fast and be not held again under the yoke of bondage.</p>
<p>2 Behold, I Paul tell you, that if you be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.</p>
<p>3 And I testify again to every man circumcising himself that he is a debtor to do the whole law.</p>
<p>4 You are made void of Christ, you who are justified in the law: you are fallen from grace.</p>
<p>5 For we in spirit, by faith, wait for the hope of justice.</p>
<p>6 For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing nor uncircumcision: but faith that worketh by Charity.</p>
<p>7 You did run well. What hath hindered you, that you should not obey the truth?</p>
<p>8 This persuasion is not from him that calleth you.</p>
<p>9 A little leaven corrupteth the whole lump.</p>
<p>10 I have confidence in you in the Lord that you will not be of another mind: but he that troubleth you shall bear the judgment, whosoever he be.</p>
<p>11 And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? Then is the scandal of the cross made void.</p>
<p>12 I would they were even cut off, who trouble you.</p>
<p>13 For you, brethren, have been called unto liberty. Only make not liberty an occasion to the flesh: but by charity of the spirit serve one another.</p>
<p>14 For all the law is fulfilled in one word: Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</p>
<p>15 But if you bite and devour one another: take heed you be not consumed one of another.</p>
<p>16 I say then: Walk in the spirit: and you shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh.</p>
<p>17 For the flesh lusteth against the spirit: and the spirit against the flesh: For these are contrary one to another: so that you do not the things that you would.</p>
<p>18 But if you are led by the spirit, you are not under the law.</p>
<p>19 Now the works of the flesh are manifest: which are fornication, uncleanness, immodesty, luxury,</p>
<p>20 Idolatry, witchcrafts, enmities, contentions, emulations, wraths, quarrels, dissensions, sects,</p>
<p>21 Envies, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like. Of the which I foretell you, as I have foretold to you, that they who do such things shall not obtain the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>22 But the fruit of the Spirit is, charity, joy, peace, patience, benignity, goodness, longanimity,</p>
<p>23 Mildness, faith, modesty, continency, chastity. Against such there is no law.</p>
<p>24 And they that are Christ&rsquo;s have crucified their flesh, with the vices and concupiscences.</p>
<p>25 If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.</p>
<p>26 Let us not be made desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.</p>
