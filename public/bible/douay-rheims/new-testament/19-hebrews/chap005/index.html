<h1>Chapter 5</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in the things that appertain to God, that he may offer up gifts and sacrifices for sins:</p>
<p>2 Who can have compassion on them that are ignorant and that err: because he himself also is compassed with infirmity.</p>
<p>3 And therefore he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.</p>
<p>4 Neither doth any man take the honour to himself, but he that is called by God, as Aaron was.</p>
<p>5 So Christ also did not glorify himself, that he might be made a high priest: but he that said unto him: Thou art my Son: this day have I begotten thee.</p>
<p>6 As he saith also in another place: Thou art a priest for ever, according to the order of Melchisedech.</p>
<p>7 Who in the days of his flesh, with a strong cry and tears, offering up prayers and supplications to him that was able to save him from death, was heard for his reverence.</p>
<p>8 And whereas indeed he was the Son of God, he learned obedience by the things which he suffered.</p>
<p>9 And being consummated, he became, to all that obey him, the cause of eternal salvation:</p>
<p>10 Called by God a high priest, according to the order of Melchisedech.</p>
<p>11 Of whom we have much to say and hard to be intelligibly uttered: because you are become weak to hear.</p>
<p>12 For whereas for the time you ought to be masters, you have need to be taught again what are the first elements of the words of God: and you are become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat.</p>
<p>13 For every one that is a partaker of milk is unskilful in the word of justice: for he is a little child.</p>
<p>14 But strong meat is for the perfect: for them who by custom have their senses exercised to the discerning of good and evil.</p>
