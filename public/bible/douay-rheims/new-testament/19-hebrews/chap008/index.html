<p>1 Now of the things which we have spoken, this is the sum: We have such an high priest who is set on the right hand of the throne of majesty in the heavens,</p>
<p>2 A minister of the holies and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord hath pitched, and not man.</p>
<p>3 For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is necessary that he also should have some thing to offer.</p>
<p>4 If then he were on earth, he would not be a priest: seeing that there would be others to offer gifts according to the law.</p>
<p>5 Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things. As it was answered to Moses, when he was to finish the tabernacle: See (saith he) that thou make all things according to the pattern which was shewn thee on the mount.</p>
<p>6 But now he hath obtained a better ministry, by how much also he is a mediator of a better testament which is established on better promises.</p>
<p>7 For if that former had been faultless, there should not indeed a place have been sought for a second.</p>
<p>8 For, finding fault with them, he saith: Behold the days shall come, saith the Lord: and I will perfect, unto the house of Israel and unto the house of Juda, a new testament:</p>
<p>9 Not according to the testament which I made to their fathers, on the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt: because they continued not in my testament: and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.</p>
<p>10 For this is the testament which I will make to the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord: I will give my laws into their mind: and in their heart will I write them. And I will be their God: and they shall be my people.</p>
<p>11 And they shall not teach every man his neighbour and every man his brother, saying: Know the Lord. For all shall know me, from the least to the greatest of them.</p>
<p>12 Because I will be merciful to their iniquities: and their sins I will remember no more.</p>
<p>13 Now in saying a new, he hath made the former old. And that which decayeth and groweth old is near its end.</p>
