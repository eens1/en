<p>1 Therefore if you be risen with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is sitting at the right hand of God.</p>
<p>2 Mind the things that are above, not the things that are upon the earth.</p>
<p>3 For you are dead: and your life is hid with Christ in God.</p>
<p>4 When Christ shall appear, who is your life, then you also shall appear with him in glory.</p>
<p>5 Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth: fornication, uncleanness, lust, evil concupiscence and covetousness, which is the service of idols.</p>
<p>6 For which things the wrath of God cometh upon the children of unbelief.</p>
<p>7 In which you also walked some time, when you lived in them.</p>
<p>8 But now put you also all away: anger, indignation, malice, blasphemy, filthy speech out of your mouth.</p>
<p>9 Lie not one to another: stripping yourselves of the old man with his deeds,</p>
<p>10 And putting on the new, him who is renewed unto knowledge, according to the image of him that created him.</p>
<p>11 Where there is neither Gentile nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian nor Scythian, bond nor free. But Christ is all and in all.</p>
<p>12 Put ye on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, the bowels of mercy, benignity, humility, modesty, patience:</p>
<p>13 Bearing with one another and forgiving one another, if any have a complaint against another. Even as the Lord hath forgiven you, so do you also.</p>
<p>14 But above all these things have charity, which is the bond of perfection.</p>
<p>15 And let the peace of Christ rejoice in your hearts, wherein also you are called in one body: and be ye thankful.</p>
<p>16 Let the word of Christ dwell in you abundantly: in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another in psalms, hymns and spiritual canticles, singing in grace in your hearts to God.</p>
<p>17 All whatsoever you do in word or in work, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.</p>
<p>18 Wives, be subject to your husbands, as it behoveth in the Lord.</p>
<p>19 Husbands, love your wives and be not bitter towards them.</p>
<p>20 Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well pleasing to the Lord.</p>
<p>21 Fathers, provoke not your children to indignation, lest they be discouraged.</p>
<p>22 Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh: not serving to the eye, as pleasing men: but in simplicity of heart, fearing God.</p>
<p>23 Whatsoever you do, do it from the heart, as to the Lord, and not to men:</p>
<p>24 Knowing that you shall receive of the Lord the reward of inheritance. Serve ye the Lord Christ.</p>
<p>25 For he that doth wrong shall receive for that which he hath done wrongfully. And there is no respect of persons with God.</p>
