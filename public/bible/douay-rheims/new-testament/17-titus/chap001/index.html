<h1>Chapter 1</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of the elect of God and the acknowledging of the truth, which is according to godliness:</p>
<p>2 Unto the hope of life everlasting, which God, who lieth not, hath promised before the times of the world:</p>
<p>3 But hath in due times manifested his word in preaching, which is committed to me according to the commandment of God our Saviour:</p>
<p>4 To Titus, my beloved son according to the common faith, grace and peace, from God the Father and from Christ Jesus our Saviour.</p>
<p>5 For this cause I left thee in Crete: that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting and shouldest ordain priests in every city, as I also appointed thee:</p>
<p>6 If any be without crime, the husband of one wife. having faithful children, not accused of riot or unruly.</p>
<p>7 For a bishop must be without crime, as the steward of God: not proud, not subject to anger, nor given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre:</p>
<p>8 But given to hospitality, gentle, sober, just, holy, continent:</p>
<p>9 Embracing that faithful word which is according to doctrine, that he may be able to exhort in sound doctrine and to convince the gainsayers.</p>
<p>10 For there are also many disobedient, vain talkers and seducers: especially they who are of the circumcision.</p>
<p>11 Who must be reproved, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p>12 One of them a prophet of their own, said: The Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, slothful bellies.</p>
<p>13 This testimony is true. Wherefore, rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith:</p>
<p>14 Not giving heed to Jewish fables and commandments of men who turn themselves away from the truth.</p>
<p>15 All things are clean to the clean: but to them that are defiled and to unbelievers, nothing is clean: but both their mind and their conscience are defiled.</p>
<p>16 They profess that they know God: but in their works they deny him: being abominable and incredulous and to every good work reprobate.</p>
