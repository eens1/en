<h1>Chapter 5</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 But of the times and moments, brethren, you need not, that we should write to you:</p>
<p>2 For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord shall so come as a thief in the night.</p>
<p>3 For when they shall say: Peace and security; then shall sudden destruction come upon them, as the pains upon her that is with child, and they shall not escape.</p>
<p>4 But you, brethren, are not in darkness, that the day should overtake you as a thief.</p>
<p>5 For all you are the children of light and children of the day: we are not of the night nor of darkness.</p>
<p>6 Therefore, let us not sleep, as others do: but let us watch, and be sober.</p>
<p>7 For they that sleep, sleep in the night; and they that are drunk, are drunk in the night.</p>
<p>8 But let us, who are of the day, be sober, having on the breast plate of faith and charity and, for a helmet, the hope of salvation.</p>
<p>9 For God hath not appointed us unto wrath: but unto the purchasing of salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,</p>
<p>10 Who died for us: that, whether we watch or sleep, we may live together with him.</p>
<p>11 For which cause comfort one another and edify one another, as you also do.</p>
<p>12 And we beseech you, brethren, to know them who labour among you and are over you in the Lord and admonish you;</p>
<p>13 That you esteem them more abundantly in charity, for their work&rsquo;s sake. Have peace with them.</p>
<p>14 And we beseech you, brethren, rebuke the unquiet: comfort the feeble minded: support the weak: be patient towards all men.</p>
<p>15 See that none render evil for evil to any man: but ever follow that which is good towards each other and towards all men.</p>
<p>16 Always rejoice.</p>
<p>17 Pray without ceasing.</p>
<p>18 In all things give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you all.</p>
<p>19 Extinguish not the spirit.</p>
<p>20 Despise not prophecies.</p>
<p>21 But prove all things: hold fast that which is good.</p>
<p>22 From all appearance of evil refrain yourselves.</p>
<p>23 And may the God of peace himself sanctify you in all things: that your whole spirit and soul and body may be preserved blameless in the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>24 He is faithful who hath called you, who also will do it.</p>
<p>25 Brethren, pray for us.</p>
<p>26 Salute all the brethren with a holy kiss.</p>
<p>27 I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read to all the holy brethren.</p>
<p>28 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.</p>
