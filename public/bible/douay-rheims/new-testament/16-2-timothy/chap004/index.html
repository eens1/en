<h1>Chapter 4</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 I charge thee, before God and Jesus Christ, who shall judge the living and the dead, by his coming and his kingdom:</p>
<p>2 Preach the word: be instant in season, out of season: reprove, entreat, rebuke in all patience and doctrine.</p>
<p>3 For there shall be a time when they will not endure sound doctrine but, according to their own desires, they will heap to themselves teachers having itching ears:</p>
<p>4 And will indeed turn away their hearing from the truth, but will be turned unto fables.</p>
<p>5 But be thou vigilant, labour in all things, do the work of an evangelist, fulfil thy ministry. Be sober.</p>
<p>6 For I am even now ready to be sacrificed: and the time of my dissolution is at hand.</p>
<p>7 I have fought a good fight: I have finished my course: I have kept the faith.</p>
<p>8 As to the rest, there is laid up for me a crown of justice which the Lord the just judge will render to me in that day: and not only to me, but to them also that love his coming. Make haste to come to me quickly.</p>
<p>9 For Demas hath left me, loving this world, and is gone to Thessalonica:</p>
<p>10 Crescens into Galatia, Titus into Dalmatia.</p>
<p>11 Only Luke is with me. Take Mark and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry.</p>
<p>12 But Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus.</p>
<p>13 The cloak that I left at Troas, with Carpus, when thou comest, bring with thee: and the books, especially the parchments.</p>
<p>14 Alexander the coppersmith hath done me much evil: the Lord will reward him according to his works:</p>
<p>15 Whom do thou also avoid: for he hath greatly withstood our words.</p>
<p>16 At my first answer, no man stood with me: but all forsook me. May it not be laid to their charge!</p>
<p>17 But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me, that by me the preaching may be accomplished and that all the Gentiles may hear. And I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.</p>
<p>18 The Lord hath delivered me from every evil work and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom. To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p>19 Salute Prisca, and Aquila and the household of Onesiphorus.</p>
<p>20 Erastus remained at Corinth. And Trophimus I left sick at Miletus.</p>
<p>21 Make haste to come before winter. Eubulus and Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the brethren, salute thee.</p>
<p>22 The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.</p>
