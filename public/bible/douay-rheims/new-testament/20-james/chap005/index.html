<p>1 Go to now, ye rich men: weep and howl in your miseries, which shall come upon you.</p>
<p>2 Your riches are corrupted: and your garments are motheaten.</p>
<p>3 Your gold and silver is cankered: and the rust of them shall be for a testimony against you and shall eat your flesh like fire. You have stored up to yourselves wrath against the last days.</p>
<p>4 Behold the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which by fraud has been kept back by you, crieth: and the cry of them hath entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth.</p>
<p>5 You have feasted upon earth: and in riotousness you have nourished your hearts, in the day of slaughter.</p>
<p>6 You have condemned and put to death the Just One: and he resisted you not.</p>
<p>7 Be patient therefore, brethren, until the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth: patiently bearing till he receive the early and latter rain.</p>
<p>8 Be you therefore also patient and strengthen your hearts: for the coming of the Lord is at hand.</p>
<p>9 Grudge not, brethren, one against another, that you may not be judged. Behold the judge standeth before the door.</p>
<p>10 Take, my brethren, for example of suffering evil, of labour and patience, the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.</p>
<p>11 Behold, we account them blessed who have endured. You have heard of the patience of Job and you have seen the end of the Lord, that the Lord is merciful and compassionate.</p>
<p>12 But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, nor by the earth, nor by any other oath. But let your speech be: Yea, Yea: No, No: that you fall not under judgment.</p>
<p>13 Is any of you sad? Let him pray: Is he cheerful in mind? Let him sing.</p>
<p>14 Is any man sick among you? Let him bring in the priests of the church and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.</p>
<p>15 And the prayer of faith shall save the sick man. And the Lord shall raise him up: and if he be in sins, they shall be forgiven him.</p>
<p>16 Confess therefore your sins one to another: and pray one for another, that you may be saved. For the continual prayer of a just man availeth much.</p>
<p>17 Elias was a man passible like unto us: and with prayer he prayed that it might not rain upon the earth. And it rained not for three years and six months.</p>
<p>18 And he prayed again. And the heaven gave rain: and the earth brought forth her fruit.</p>
<p>19 My brethren, if any of you err from the truth and one convert him:</p>
<p>20 He must know that he who causeth a sinner to be converted from the error of his way shall save his soul from death and shall cover a multitude of sins.</p>
