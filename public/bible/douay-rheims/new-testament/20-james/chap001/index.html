<h1>Chapter 1</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 James, the servant of God and of our Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.</p>
<p>2 My brethren, count it all joy, when you shall fall into divers temptations:</p>
<p>3 Knowing that the trying of your faith worketh patience</p>
<p>4 And patience hath a perfect work: that you may be perfect and entire, failing in nothing.</p>
<p>5 But if any of you want wisdom, let him ask of God who giveth to all men abundantly and upbraideth not. And it shall be given him.</p>
<p>6 But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea, which is moved and carried about by the wind.</p>
<p>7 Therefore let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.</p>
<p>8 A double minded man is inconstant in all his ways.</p>
<p>9 But let the brother of low condition glory in his exaltation:</p>
<p>10 And the rich, in his being low: because as the flower of the grass shall he pass away.</p>
<p>11 For the sun rose with a burning heat and parched the grass: and the flower thereof fell off, and the beauty of the shape thereof perished. So also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.</p>
<p>12 Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for, when he hath been proved, he shall receive the crown of life which God hath promised to them that love him.</p>
<p>13 Let no man, when he is tempted, say that he is tempted by God. For God is not a tempter of evils: and he tempteth no man.</p>
<p>14 But every man is tempted by his own concupiscence, being drawn away and allured.</p>
<p>15 Then, when concupiscence hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin. But sin, when it is completed, begetteth death.</p>
<p>16 Do not err, therefore, my dearest brethren.</p>
<p>17 Every best gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no change nor shadow of alteration.</p>
<p>18 For of his own will hath he begotten us by the word of truth, that we might be some beginning of his creature.</p>
<p>19 You know, my dearest brethren. And let every man be swift to hear, but slow to speak and slow to anger.</p>
<p>20 For the anger of man worketh not the justice of God.</p>
<p>21 Wherefore, casting away all uncleanness and abundance of naughtiness, with meekness receive the ingrafted word, which is able to save your souls.</p>
<p>22 But be ye doers of the word and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.</p>
<p>23 For if a man be a hearer of the word and not a doer, he shall be compared to a man beholding his own countenance in a glass.</p>
<p>24 For he beheld himself and went his way and presently forgot what manner of man he was.</p>
<p>25 But he that hath looked into the perfect law of liberty and hath continued therein, not becoming a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work: this man shall be blessed in his deed.</p>
<p>26 And if any man think himself to be religious, not bridling his tongue but deceiving his own heart, this man&rsquo;s religion is vain.</p>
<p>27 Religion clean and undefiled before God and the Father is this: to visit the fatherless and widows in their tribulation and to keep one&rsquo;s self unspotted from this world.</p>
