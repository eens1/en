<h1>Chapter 1</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 The Ancient to the lady Elect and her children, whom I love in the truth: and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth,</p>
<p>2 For the sake of the truth which dwelleth in us and shall be with us for ever.</p>
<p>3 Grace be with you, mercy and peace from God the Father and from Christ Jesus the Son of the Father: in truth and charity.</p>
<p>4 I was exceeding glad that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.</p>
<p>5 And now I beseech thee, lady, not as writing a new commandment to thee, but that which we have had from the beginning, that we love one another.</p>
<p>6 And this is charity: That we walk according to his commandments. For this is the commandment that, as you have heard from the beginning, you should walk in the same:</p>
<p>7 For many seducers are gone out into the world who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a seducer and an antichrist.</p>
<p>8 Look to yourselves, that you lose not the things which you have wrought: but that you may receive a full reward.</p>
<p>9 Whosoever revolteth and continueth not in the doctrine of Christ hath not God. He that continueth in the doctrine, the same hath both the Father and the Son.</p>
<p>10 If any man come to you and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into the house nor say to him: God speed you.</p>
<p>11 For he that saith unto him: God speed you, communicateth with his wicked works.</p>
<p>12 Having more things to write unto you, I would not by paper and ink: for I hope that I shall be with you and speak face to face, that your joy may be full.</p>
<p>13 The children of thy sister Elect salute thee.</p>
