<p>1 And in those days cometh John the Baptist preaching in the desert of Judea.</p>
<p>2 And saying: Do penance: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</p>
<p>3 For this is he that was spoken of by Isaias the prophet, saying: A voice of one crying in the desert, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight his paths.</p>
<p>4 And the same John had his garment of camel&rsquo;s hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins: and his meat was locusts and wild honey.</p>
<p>5 Then went out to him Jerusalem and all Judea, and all the country about Jordan:</p>
<p>6 And were baptized by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.</p>
<p>7 And seeing many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them: Ye brood of vipers, who hath shewed you to flee from the wrath to come?</p>
<p>8 Bring forth therefore fruit worthy of penance.</p>
<p>9 And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham for our father. For I tell you that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.</p>
<p>10 For now the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that doth not yield good fruit, shall be cut down, and cast into the fire.</p>
<p>11 I indeed baptize you in water unto penance, but he that shall come after me, is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you in the Holy Ghost and fire.</p>
<p>12 Whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his floor and gather his wheat into the barn; but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.</p>
<p>13 Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to the Jordan, unto John, to be baptized by him.</p>
<p>14 But John stayed him, saying: I ought to be baptized by thee, and comest thou to me?</p>
<p>15 And Jesus answering, said to him: Suffer it to be so now. For so it becometh us to fulfil all justice. Then he suffered him.</p>
<p>16 And Jesus being baptized, forthwith came out of the water: and lo, the heavens were opened to him: and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming upon him.</p>
<p>17 And behold a voice from heaven saying: This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</p>
