<article>
<p>1 Before the festival day of the pasch, Jesus knowing that his hour was come, that he should pass out of this world to the Father: having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them unto the end.</p>
<p>2 And when supper was done (the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, to betray him),</p>
<p>3 Knowing that the Father had given him all things into his hands and that he came from God and goeth to God,</p>
<p>4 He riseth from supper and layeth aside his garments and, having taken a towel, girded himself.</p>
<p>5 After that, he putteth water into a basin and began to wash the feet of the disciples and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded.</p>
<p>6 He cometh therefore to Simon Peter. And Peter saith to him: Lord, dost thou wash my feet?</p>
<p>7 Jesus answered and said to him: What I do, thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter.</p>
<p>8 Peter saith to him: Thou shalt never wash my feet, Jesus answered him: If I wash thee not, thou shalt have no part with me.</p>
<p>9 Simon Peter saith to him: Lord, not only my feet, but also my hands and my head.</p>
<p>10 Jesus saith to him: He that is washed needeth not but to wash his feet, but is clean wholly. And you are clean, but not all.</p>
<p>11 For he knew who he was that would betray him; therefore he said: You are not all clean.</p>
<p>12 Then after he had washed their feet and taken his garments, being set down again, he said to them: Know you what I have done to you?</p>
<p>13 You call me Master and Lord. And you say well: for so I am.</p>
<p>14 If then I being your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; you also ought to wash one another&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<p>15 For I have given you an example, that as I have done to you, so you do also.</p>
<p>16 Amen, amen, I say to you: The servant is not greater than his lord: neither is the apostle greater than he that sent him.</p>
<p>17 If you know these things, you shall be blessed if you do them.</p>
<p>18 I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen. But that the scripture may be fulfilled: He that eateth bread with me shall lift up his heel against me,</p>
<p>19 At present I tell you, before it come to pass: that when it shall come to pass, you may believe that I am he.</p>
<p>20 Amen, amen, I say to you, he that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me: and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.</p>
<p>21 When Jesus had said these things, he was troubled in spirit; and he testified, and said: Amen, amen, I say to you, one of you shall betray me.</p>
<p>22 The disciples therefore looked one upon another, doubting of whom he spoke.</p>
<p>23 Now there was leaning on Jesus&rsquo; bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.</p>
<p>24 Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him and said to him: Who is it of whom he speaketh?</p>
<p>25 He therefore, leaning on the breast of Jesus, saith to him: Lord, who is it?</p>
<p>26 Jesus answered: He it is to whom I shall reach bread dipped. And when he had dipped the bread, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.</p>
<p>27 And after the morsel, Satan entered into him. And Jesus said to him: That which thou dost, do quickly.</p>
<p>28 Now no man at the table knew to what purpose he said this unto him.</p>
<p>29 For some thought, because Judas had the purse, that Jesus had said to him: Buy those things which we have need of for the festival day: or that he should give something to the poor.</p>
<p>30 He therefore, having received the morsel, went out immediately. And it was night.</p>
<p>31 When he therefore was gone out, Jesus said: Now is the Son of man glorified; and God is glorified in him.</p>
<p>32 If God be glorified in him, God also will glorify him in himself: and immediately will he glorify him.</p>
<p>33 Little children, yet a little while I am with you. You shall seek me. And as I said to the Jews: Whither I go you cannot come; so I say to you now.</p>
<p>34 A new commandment I give unto you: That you love one another, as I have loved you, that you also love one another.</p>
<p>35 By this shall all men know that you are my disciples, if you have love one for another.</p>
<p>36 Simon Peter saith to him: Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered: Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now: but thou shalt follow hereafter.</p>
<p>37 Peter saith to him: Why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thee.</p>
<p>38 Jesus answered him: Wilt thou lay down thy life for me? Amen, amen, I say to thee, the cock shall not crow, till thou deny me thrice.</p>
