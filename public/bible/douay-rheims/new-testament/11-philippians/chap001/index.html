<article>
<p>1 Paul and Timothy, the servants of Jesus Christ: to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons.</p>
<p>2 Grace be unto you and peace, from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>3 I give thanks to my God in every remembrance of you:</p>
<p>4 Always in all my prayers making supplication for you all with joy:</p>
<p>5 For your communication in the gospel of Christ, from the first day unto now.</p>
<p>6 Being confident of this very thing: that he who hath begun a good work in you will perfect it unto the day of Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>7 As it is meet for me to think this for you all, for that I have you in my heart; and that, in my bands and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers of my joy.</p>
<p>8 For God is my witness how I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>9 And this I pray: That your charity may more and more abound in knowledge and in all understanding:</p>
<p>10 That you may approve the better things: that you may be sincere and without offence unto the day of Christ:</p>
<p>11 Filled with the fruit of justice, through Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.</p>
<p>12 Now, brethren, I desire you should know that the things which have happened to me have fallen out rather to the furtherance of the gospel:</p>
<p>13 So that my bands are made manifest in Christ, in all the court and in all other places.</p>
<p>14 And many of the brethren in the Lord, growing confident by my bands, are much more bold to speak the word of God without fear.</p>
<p>15 Some indeed, even out of envy and contention: but some also for good will preach Christ.</p>
<p>16 Some out of charity, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel.</p>
<p>17 And some out of contention preach Christ not sincerely: supposing that they raise affliction to my bands.</p>
<p>18 But what then? So that by all means, whether by occasion or by truth, Christ be preached: in this also I rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.</p>
<p>19 For I know that this shall fall out to me unto salvation, through your prayer and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,</p>
<p>20 According to my expectation and hope; that in nothing I shall be confounded: but with all confidence, as always, so now also, shall Christ be magnified in my body, whether it be by life or by death.</p>
<p>21 For to me, to live is Christ: and to die is gain.</p>
<p>22 And if to live in the flesh: this is to me the fruit of labour. And what I shall choose I know not.</p>
<p>23 But I am straitened between two: having a desire to be dissolved and to be with Christ, a thing by far the better.</p>
<p>24 But to abide still in the flesh is needful for you.</p>
<p>25 And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all, for your furtherance and joy of faith:</p>
<p>26 That your rejoicing may abound in Christ Jesus for me, by my coming to you again.</p>
<p>27 Only let your conversation be worthy of the gospel of Christ: that, whether I come and see you, or, being absent, may hear of you, that you stand fast in one spirit, with one mind labouring together for the faith of the gospel.</p>
<p>28 And in nothing be ye terrified by the adversaries: which to them is a cause of perdition, but to you of salvation, and this from God.</p>
<p>29 For unto you it is given for Christ, not only to believe in him, but also to suffer for him:</p>
<p>30 Having the same conflict as that which you have seen in me and now have heard of me.</p>
