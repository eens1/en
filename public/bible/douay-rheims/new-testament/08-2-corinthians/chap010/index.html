<p>1 Now I Paul, myself beseech you, by the mildness and modesty of Christ: who in presence indeed am lowly among you, but being absent am bold toward you.</p>
<p>2 But I beseech you, that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence wherewith I am thought to be bold, against some who reckon us as if we walked according to the flesh.</p>
<p>3 For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh.</p>
<p>4 For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty to God, unto the pulling down of fortifications, destroying counsels,</p>
<p>5 And every height that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God: and bringing into captivity every understanding unto the obedience of Christ:</p>
<p>6 And having in readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience shall be fulfilled.</p>
<p>7 See the things that are according to outward appearance. If any man trust to himself, that he is Christ&rsquo;s let him think this again with himself, that as he is Christ&rsquo;s, so are we also.</p>
<p>8 For if also I should boast somewhat more of our power, which the Lord hath given us unto edification and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed.</p>
<p>9 But that I may not be thought as it were to terrify you by epistles,</p>
<p>10 (For his epistles indeed, say they, are weighty and strong; but his bodily presence is weak and his speech contemptible):</p>
<p>11 Let such a one think this, that such as we are in word by epistles when absent, such also we will be indeed when present.</p>
<p>12 For we dare not match or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but we measure ourselves by ourselves and compare ourselves with ourselves.</p>
<p>13 But we will not glory beyond our measure: but according to the measure of the rule which God hath measured to us, a measure to reach even unto you.</p>
<p>14 For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as if we reached not unto you. For we are come as far as to you in the Gospel of Christ.</p>
<p>15 Not glorying beyond measure in other men&rsquo;s labours: but having hope of your increasing faith, to be magnified in you according to our rule abundantly.</p>
<p>16 Yea, unto those places that are beyond you to preach the gospel: not to glory in another man&rsquo;s rule, in those things that are made ready to our hand.</p>
<p>17 But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.</p>
<p>18 For not he who commendeth himself is approved: but he, whom God commendeth.</p>
