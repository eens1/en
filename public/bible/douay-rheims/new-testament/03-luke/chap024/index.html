<p>1 And on the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came to the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared.</p>
<p>2 And they found the stone rolled back from the sepulchre.</p>
<p>3 And going in, they found not the body of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>4 And it came to pass, as they were astonished in their mind at this, behold, two men stood by them, in shining apparel.</p>
<p>5 And as they were afraid and bowed down their countenance towards the ground, they said unto them: Why seek you the living with the dead?</p>
<p>6 He is not here, but is risen. Remember how he spoke unto you, when he was yet in Galilee,</p>
<p>7 Saying: The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and the third day rise again.</p>
<p>8 And they remembered his words.</p>
<p>9 And going back from the sepulchre, they told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest.</p>
<p>10 And it was Mary Magdalen and Joanna and Mary of James and the other women that were with them, who told these things to the apostles.</p>
<p>11 And these words seemed to them as idle tales: and they did not believe them.</p>
<p>12 But Peter rising up, ran to the sepulchre and, stooping down, he saw the linen cloths laid by themselves: and went away wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.</p>
<p>13 And behold, two of them went, the same day, to a town which was sixty furlongs from Jerusalem, named Emmaus.</p>
<p>14 And they talked together of all these things which had happened.</p>
<p>15 And it came to pass that while they talked and reasoned with themselves, Jesus himself also, drawing near, went with them.</p>
<p>16 But their eyes were held, that they should not know him.</p>
<p>17 And he said to them: What are these discourses that you hold one with another as you walk and are sad?</p>
<p>18 And the one of them, whose name was Cleophas, answering, said to him: Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things that have been done there in these days?</p>
<p>19 To whom he said: What things? And they said: Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet, mighty in work and word before God and all the people.</p>
<p>20 And how our chief priests and princes delivered him to be condemned to death and crucified him.</p>
<p>21 But we hoped that it was he that should have redeemed Israel. And now besides all this, to-day is the third day since these things were done.</p>
<p>22 Yea and certain women also of our company affrighted us who, before it was light, were at the sepulchre,</p>
<p>23 And not finding his body, came, saying that they had all seen a vision of angels, who say that he is alive.</p>
<p>24 And some of our people went to the sepulchre and found it so as the women had said: but him they found not.</p>
<p>25 Then he said to them: O foolish and slow of heart to believe in all things, Which the prophets have spoken.</p>
<p>26 Ought not Christ to have suffered these things and so, to enter into his glory?</p>
<p>27 And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded to them in all the scriptures the things that were concerning him.</p>
<p>28 And they drew nigh to the town whither they were going: and he made as though he would go farther.</p>
<p>29 But they constrained him, saying: Stay with us, because it is towards evening and the day is now far spent. And he went in with them.</p>
<p>30 And it came to pass, whilst he was at table with them, he took bread and blessed and brake and gave to them.</p>
<p>31 And their eyes were opened: and they knew him. And he vanished out of their sight.</p>
<p>32 And they said one to the other: Was not our heart burning within us, whilst he spoke in the way and opened to us the scriptures?</p>
<p>33 And rising up, the same hour, they went back to Jerusalem: and they found the eleven gathered together, and those that were with them,</p>
<p>34 Saying: The Lord is risen indeed and hath appeared to Simon.</p>
<p>35 And they told what things were done in the way: and how they knew him in the breaking of bread.</p>
<p>36 Now, whilst they were speaking these things, Jesus stood in the midst of them and saith to them: Peace be to you. It is I: Fear not.</p>
<p>37 But they being troubled and frightened, supposed that they saw a spirit.</p>
<p>38 And he said to them: Why are you troubled, and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?</p>
<p>39 See my hands and feet, that it is I myself. Handle, and see: for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as you see me to have.</p>
<p>40 And when he had said this, he shewed them his hands and feet.</p>
<p>41 But while they yet believed not and wondered for joy, he said: Have you here any thing to eat?</p>
<p>42 And they offered him a piece of a broiled fish and a honeycomb.</p>
<p>43 And when he had eaten before them, taking the remains, he gave to them.</p>
<p>44 And he said to them: These are the words which I spoke to you while I was yet with you, that all things must needs be fulfilled which are written in the law of Moses and in the prophets and in the psalms, concerning me.</p>
<p>45 Then he opened their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures.</p>
<p>46 And he said to them: Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer and to rise again from the dead, the third day:</p>
<p>47 And that penance and remission of sins should be preached in his name, unto all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</p>
<p>48 And you are witnesses of these things.</p>
<p>49 And I send the promise of my Father upon you: but stay you in the city till you be endued with power from on high.</p>
<p>50 And he led them out as far as Bethania: and lifting up his hands, he blessed them.</p>
<p>51 And it came to pass, whilst he blessed them, he departed from them and was carried up to heaven.</p>
<p>52 And they adoring went back into Jerusalem with great joy.</p>
<p>53 And they were always in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.</p>
