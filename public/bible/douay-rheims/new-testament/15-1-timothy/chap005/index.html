<article>
<p>1 An ancient man rebuke not, but entreat him as a father: young men, as brethren:</p>
<p>2 Old women, as mothers: young women, as sisters, in all chastity.</p>
<p>3 Honour widows that are widows indeed.</p>
<p>4 But if any widow have children or grandchildren, let her learn first to govern her own house and to make a return of duty to her parents; for this is acceptable before God.</p>
<p>5 But she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, let her trust in God and continue in supplications and prayers night and day.</p>
<p>6 For she that liveth in pleasures is dead while she is living.</p>
<p>7 And this give in charge, that they may be blameless.</p>
<p>8 But if any man have not care of his own and especially of those of his house, he hath denied the faith and is worse than an infidel.</p>
<p>9 Let a widow be chosen of no less than threescore years of age, who hath been the wife of one husband.</p>
<p>10 Having testimony for her good works, if she have brought up children, if she have received to harbour, if she have washed the saints&rsquo; feet, if she have ministered to them that suffer tribulation, if she have diligently followed every good work.</p>
<p>11 But the younger widows avoid. For when they have grown wanton in Christ, they will marry:</p>
<p>12 Having damnation, because they have made void their first faith.</p>
<p>13 And withal being idle they learn to go about from house to house: and are not only idle, but tattlers also and busy bodies, speaking things which they ought not.</p>
<p>14 I will, therefore, that the younger should marry, bear children, be mistresses of families, give no occasion to the adversary to speak evil.</p>
<p>15 For some are already turned aside after Satan.</p>
<p>16 If any of the faithful have widows, let him minister to them, and let not the church be charged: that there may be sufficient for them that are widows indeed.</p>
<p>17 Let the priests that rule well be esteemed worthy of double honour: especially they who labour in the word and doctrine.</p>
<p>18 For the scripture saith: Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn: and, The labourer is worthy of his reward.</p>
<p>19 Against a priest receive not an accusation, but under two or three witnesses.</p>
<p>20 Them that sin reprove before all that the rest also may have fear.</p>
<p>21 I charge thee, before God and Christ Jesus and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without prejudice, doing nothing by declining to either side.</p>
<p>22 Impose not hands lightly upon any man, neither be partaker of other men&rsquo;s sins. Keep thyself chaste.</p>
<p>23 Do not still drink water, but use a little wine for thy stomach&rsquo;s sake and thy frequent infirmities.</p>
<p>24 Some men&rsquo;s sins are manifest, going before to judgment: and some men they follow after.</p>
<p>25 In like manner also good deeds are manifest: and they that are otherwise cannot be hid.</p>
