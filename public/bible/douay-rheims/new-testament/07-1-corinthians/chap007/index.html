<p>1 Now concerning the things whereof you wrote to me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.</p>
<p>2 But for fear of fornication, let every man have his own wife: and let every woman have her own husband.</p>
<p>3 Let the husband render the debt to his wife: and the wife also in like manner to the husband.</p>
<p>4 The wife hath not power of her own body: but the husband. And in like manner the husband also hath not power of his own body: but the wife.</p>
<p>5 Defraud not one another, except, perhaps, by consent, for a time, that you may give yourselves to prayer: and return together again, lest Satan tempt you for your incontinency.</p>
<p>6 But I speak this by indulgence, not by commandment.</p>
<p>7 For I would that all men were even as myself. But every one hath his proper gift from God: one after this manner, and another after that.</p>
<p>8 But I say to the unmarried and to the widows: It is good for them if they so continue, even as I.</p>
<p>9 But if they do not contain themselves, let them marry. For it is better to marry than to be burnt.</p>
<p>10 But to them that are married, not I, but the Lord, commandeth that the wife depart not from her husband.</p>
<p>11 And if she depart, that she remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband. And let not the husband put away his wife.</p>
<p>12 For to the rest I speak, not the Lord. If any brother hath a wife that believeth not and she consent to dwell with him: let him not put her away.</p>
<p>13 And if any woman hath a husband that believeth not and he consent to dwell with her: let her not put away her husband.</p>
<p>14 For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the believing wife: and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the believing husband. Otherwise your children should be unclean: but now they are holy.</p>
<p>15 But if the unbeliever depart, let him depart. For a brother or sister is not under servitude in such cases. But God hath called us in peace.</p>
<p>16 For how knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband? Or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy wife?</p>
<p>17 But as the Lord hath distributed to every one, as God hath called every one: so let him walk. And so in all churches I teach.</p>
<p>18 Is any man called, being circumcised? Let him not procure uncircumcision. Is any man called in uncircumcision? Let him not be circumcised.</p>
<p>19 Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing: but the observance of the commandments of God.</p>
<p>20 Let every man abide in the same calling in which he was called.</p>
<p>21 Wast thou called, being a bondman? Care not for it: but if thou mayest be made free, use it rather.</p>
<p>22 For he that is called in the Lord, being a bondman, is the freeman of the Lord. Likewise he that is called, being free, is the bondman of Christ.</p>
<p>23 You are bought with a price: be not made the bondslaves of men.</p>
<p>24 Brethren, let every man, wherein he was called, therein abide with God.</p>
<p>25 Now, concerning virgins, I have no commandment of the Lord: but I give counsel, as having obtained mercy of the Lord, to be faithful.</p>
<p>26 I think therefore that this is good for the present necessity: that it is good for a man so to be.</p>
<p>27 Art thou bound to a wife? Seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? Seek not a wife.</p>
<p>28 But if thou take a wife, thou hast not sinned. And if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned: nevertheless, such shall have tribulation of the flesh. But I spare you.</p>
<p>29 This therefore I say, brethren: The time is short. It remaineth, that they also who have wives be as if they had none:</p>
<p>30 And they that weep, as though they wept not: and they that rejoice, as if they rejoiced not: and they that buy as if they possessed not:</p>
<p>31 And they that use this world, as if they used it not. For the fashion of this world passeth away.</p>
<p>32 But I would have you to be without solicitude. He that is without a wife is solicitous for the things that belong to the Lord: how he may please God.</p>
<p>33 But he that is with a wife is solicitous for the things of the world: how he may please his wife. And he is divided.</p>
<p>34 And the unmarried woman and the virgin thinketh on the things of the Lord: that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But she that is married thinketh on the things of the world: how she may please her husband.</p>
<p>35 And this I speak for your profit, not to cast a snare upon you, but for that which is decent and which may give you power to attend upon the Lord, without impediment.</p>
<p>36 But if any man think that he seemeth dishonoured with regard to his virgin, for that she is above the age, and it must so be: let him do what he will. He sinneth not if she marry.</p>
<p>37 For he that hath determined, being steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but having power of his own will: and hath judged this in his heart, to keep his virgin, doth well.</p>
<p>38 Therefore both he that giveth his virgin in marriage doth well: and he that giveth her not doth better.</p>
<p>39 A woman is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth: but if her husband die, she is at liberty. Let her marry to whom she will: only in the Lord.</p>
<p>40 But more blessed shall she be, if she so remain, according to my counsel. And I think that I also have the spirit of God.</p>
