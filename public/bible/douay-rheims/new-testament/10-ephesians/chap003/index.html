<h1>Chapter 3</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 For this cause, I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ, for you Gentiles:</p>
<p>2 If yet you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me towards you:</p>
<p>3 How that, according to revelation, the mystery has been made known to me, as I have written above in a few words:</p>
<p>4 As you reading, may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ,</p>
<p>5 Which in other generations was not known to the sons of men, as it is now revealed to his holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit:</p>
<p>6 That the Gentiles should be fellow heirs and of the same body: and copartners of his promise in Christ Jesus, by the gospel</p>
<p>7 Of which I am made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God, which is given to me according to the operation of his power.</p>
<p>8 To me, the least of all the saints, is given this grace, to preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ:</p>
<p>9 And to enlighten all men, that they may see what is the dispensation of the mystery which hath been hidden from eternity in God who created all things:</p>
<p>10 That the manifold wisdom of God may be made known to the principalities and powers in heavenly places through the church,</p>
<p>11 According to the eternal purpose which he made in Christ Jesus our Lord:</p>
<p>12 In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.</p>
<p>13 Wherefore I pray you not to faint at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.</p>
<p>14 For this cause I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,</p>
<p>15 Of whom all paternity in heaven and earth is named:</p>
<p>16 That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened by his Spirit with might unto the inward man:</p>
<p>17 That Christ may dwell by faith in your hearts: that, being rooted and founded in charity,</p>
<p>18 You may be able to comprehend, with all the saints, what is the breadth and length and height and depth,</p>
<p>19 To know also the charity of Christ, which surpasseth all knowledge: that you may be filled unto all the fulness of God.</p>
<p>20 Now to him who is able to do all things more abundantly than we desire or understand, according to the power that worketh in us:</p>
<p>21 To him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus, unto all generations, world without end. Amen.</p>
