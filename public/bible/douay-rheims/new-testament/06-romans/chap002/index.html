<p>1 Wherefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest. For wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself. For thou dost the same things which thou judgest.</p>
<p>2 For we know that the judgment of God is, according to truth, against them that do such things.</p>
<p>3 And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them who do such things and dost the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?</p>
<p>4 Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and patience and longsuffering? Knowest thou not that the benignity of God leadeth thee to penance?</p>
<p>5 But according to thy hardness and impenitent heart, thou treasurest up to thyself wrath, against the day of wrath and revelation of the just judgment of God:</p>
<p>6 Who will render to every man according to his works.</p>
<p>7 To them indeed who, according to patience in good work, seek glory and honour and incorruption, eternal life:</p>
<p>8 But to them that are contentious and who obey not the truth but give credit to iniquity, wrath and indignation.</p>
<p>9 Tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that worketh evil: of the Jew first, and also of the Greek.</p>
<p>10 But glory and honour and peace to every one that worketh good: to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</p>
<p>11 For there is no respect of persons with God.</p>
<p>12 For whosoever have sinned without the law shall perish without the law: and whosoever have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law.</p>
<p>13 For not the hearers of the law are just before God: but the doers of the law shall be justified.</p>
<p>14 For when the Gentiles, who have not the law, do by nature those things that are of the law; these, having not the law, are a law to themselves.</p>
<p>15 Who shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness to them: and their thoughts between themselves accusing or also defending one another,</p>
<p>16 In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ, according to my gospel.</p>
<p>17 But if thou art called a Jew and restest in the law and makest thy boast of God,</p>
<p>18 And knowest his will and approvest the more profitable things, being instructed by the law:</p>
<p>19 Art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them that are in darkness,</p>
<p>20 An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of infants, having the form of knowledge and of truth in the law.</p>
<p>21 Thou therefore, that teachest another, teachest not thyself: thou, that preachest that men should not steal, stealest.</p>
<p>22 Thou, that sayest men should not commit adultery, committest adultery: thou, that abhorrest idols, committest sacrilege:</p>
<p>23 Thou, that makest thy boast of the law, by transgression of the law dishonourest God.</p>
<p>24 (For the name of God through you is blasphemed among the Gentiles, as it is written.)</p>
<p>25 Circumcision profiteth indeed, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a transgressor of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.</p>
<p>26 If then, the uncircumcised keep the justices of the law, shall not this uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?</p>
<p>27 And shall not that which by nature is uncircumcision, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision art a transgressor of the law?</p>
<p>28 For it is not he is a Jew, who is so outwardly: nor is that circumcision which is outwardly in the flesh.</p>
<p>29 But he is a Jew that is one inwardly and the circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit not in the letter: whose praise is not of men, but of God.</p>
