<h1>Chapter 1</h1>

<div class="content">
<article>
<p>1 Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God.</p>
<p>2 Which he had promised before, by his prophets, in the holy scriptures,</p>
<p>3 Concerning his Son, who was made to him of the seed of David, according to the flesh,</p>
<p>4 Who was predestinated the Son of God in power, according to the spirit of sanctification, by the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ from the dead:</p>
<p>5 By whom we have received grace and apostleship for obedience to the faith, in all nations, for his name:</p>
<p>6 Among whom are you also the called of Jesus Christ:</p>
<p>7 To all that are at Rome, the beloved of God, called to be saints. Grace to you and peace, from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>8 First, I give thanks to my God, through Jesus Christ, for you all: because your faith is spoken of in the whole world.</p>
<p>9 For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make a commemoration of you:</p>
<p>10 Always in my prayers making request, if by any means now at length I may have a prosperous journey, by the will of God, to come unto you.</p>
<p>11 For I long to see you that I may impart unto you some spiritual grace, to strengthen you:</p>
<p>12 That is to say, that I may be comforted together in you by that which is common to us both, your faith and mine.</p>
<p>13 And I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that I have often purposed to come unto you (and have been hindered hitherto) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.</p>
<p>14 To the Greeks and to the barbarians, to the wise and to the unwise, I am a debtor.</p>
<p>15 So (as much as is in me) I am ready to preach the gospel to you also that are at Rome.</p>
<p>16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel. For it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth: to the Jew first and to the Greek.</p>
<p>17 For the justice of God is revealed therein, from faith unto faith, as it is written: The just man liveth by faith.</p>
<p>18 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and injustice of those men that detain the truth of God in injustice:</p>
<p>19 Because that which is known of God is manifest in them. For God hath manifested it unto them.</p>
<p>20 For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made. His eternal power also and divinity: so that they are inexcusable.</p>
<p>21 Because that, when they knew God, they have not glorified him as God or given thanks: but became vain in their thoughts. And their foolish heart was darkened.</p>
<p>22 For, professing themselves to be wise, they became fools.</p>
<p>23 And they changed the glory of the incorruptible God into the likeness of the image of a corruptible man and of birds, and of fourfooted beasts and of creeping things.</p>
<p>24 Wherefore, God gave them up to the desires of their heart, unto uncleanness: to dishonour their own bodies among themselves.</p>
<p>25 Who changed the truth of God into a lie and worshipped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.</p>
<p>26 For this cause, God delivered them up to shameful affections. For their women have changed the natural use into that use which is against nature.</p>
<p>27 And, in like manner, the men also, leaving the natural use of the women, have burned in their lusts, one towards another: men with men, working that which is filthy and receiving in themselves the recompense which was due to their error.</p>
<p>28 And as they liked not to have God in their knowledge, God delivered them up to a reprobate sense, to do those things which are not convenient.</p>
<p>29 Being filled with all iniquity, malice, fornication, avarice, wickedness: full of envy, murder, contention, deceit, malignity: whisperers,</p>
<p>30 Detractors, hateful to God, contumelious, proud, haughty, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,</p>
<p>31 Foolish, dissolute: without affection, without fidelity, without mercy.</p>
<p>32 Who, having known the justice of God, did not understand that they who do such things, are worthy of death: and not only they that do them, but they also that consent to them that do them.</p>
