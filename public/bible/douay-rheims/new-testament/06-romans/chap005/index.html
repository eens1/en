<h1>Chapter 5</h1>

<div class="content">

<p>1 Being justified therefore by faith, let us have peace with God, through our Lord Jesus Christ:</p>
<p>2 By whom also we have access through faith into this grace wherein we stand: and glory in the hope of the glory of the sons of God.</p>
<p>3 And not only so: but we glory also in tribulation, knowing that tribulation worketh patience;</p>
<p>4 And patience trial; and trial hope;</p>
<p>5 And hope confoundeth not: because the charity of God is poured forth in our hearts, by the Holy Ghost who is given to us.</p>
<p>6 For why did Christ, when as yet we were weak, according to the time, die for the ungodly?</p>
<p>7 For scarce for a just man will one die: yet perhaps for a good man some one would dare to die.</p>
<p>8 But God commendeth his charity towards us: because when as yet we were sinners according to the time.</p>
<p>9 Christ died for us. Much more therefore, being now justified by his blood, shall we be saved from wrath through him.</p>
<p>10 For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son: much more, being reconciled, shall we be saved by his life.</p>
<p>11 And not only so: but also we glory in God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received reconciliation.</p>
<p>12 Wherefore as by one man sin entered into this world and by sin death: and so death passed upon all men, in whom all have sinned.</p>
<p>13 For until the law sin was in the world: but sin was not imputed, when the law was not.</p>
<p>14 But death reigned from Adam unto Moses, even over them also who have not sinned, after the similitude of the transgression of Adam, who is a figure of him who was to come.</p>
<p>15 But not as the offence, so also the gift. For if by the offence of one, many died: much more the grace of God and the gift, by the grace of one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.</p>
<p>16 And not as it was by one sin, so also is the gift. For judgment indeed was by one unto condemnation: but grace is of many offences unto justification.</p>
<p>17 For if by one man&rsquo;s offence death reigned through one; much more they who receive abundance of grace and of the gift and of justice shall reign in life through one, Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>18 Therefore, as by the offence of one, unto all men to condemnation: so also by the justice of one, unto all men to justification of life.</p>
<p>19 For as by the disobedience of one man, many were made sinners: so also by the obedience of one, many shall be made just.</p>
<p>20 Now the law entered in that sin might abound. And where sin abounded, grace did more abound.</p>
<p>21 That as sin hath reigned to death: so also grace might reign by justice unto life everlasting, through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
