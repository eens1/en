<article>
<p>1 What advantage then hath the Jew: or what is the profit of circumcision?</p>
<p>2 Much every way. First indeed, because the words of God were committed to them.</p>
<p>3 For what if some of them have not believed? Shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect? God forbid!</p>
<p>4 But God is true and every man a liar, as it is written: That thou mayest be justified in thy words and mayest overcome when thou art judged.</p>
<p>5 But if our injustice commend the justice of God, what shall we say? Is God unjust, who executeth wrath?</p>
<p>6 (I speak according to man.) God forbid! Otherwise how shall God judge this world?</p>
<p>7 For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie, unto his glory, why am I also yet judged as a sinner?</p>
<p>8 And not rather (as we are slandered and as some affirm that we say) let us do evil that there may come good? Whose damnation is just.</p>
<p>9 What then? Do we excel them? No, not so. For we have charged both Jews and Greeks, that they are all under sin.</p>
<p>10 As it is written: There is not any man just.</p>
<p>11 There is none that understandeth: there is none that seeketh after God.</p>
<p>12 All have turned out of the way: they are become unprofitable together: there is none that doth good, there is not so much as one.</p>
<p>13 Their throat is an open sepulchre: with their tongues they have dealt deceitfully. The venom of asps is under their lips.</p>
<p>14 Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:</p>
<p>15 Their feet swift to shed blood:</p>
<p>16 Destruction and misery in their ways:</p>
<p>17 And the way of peace they have not known.</p>
<p>18 There is no fear of God before their eyes.</p>
<p>19 Now we know that what things soever the law speaketh, it speaketh to them that are in the law: that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may be made subject to God.</p>
<p>20 Because by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified before him. For by the law is the knowledge of sin.</p>
<p>21 But now, without the law, the justice of God is made manifest, being witnessed by the law and the prophets.</p>
<p>22 Even the justice of God, by faith of Jesus Christ, unto all, and upon all them that believe in him: for there is no distinction.</p>
<p>23 For all have sinned and do need the glory of God.</p>
<p>24 Being justified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,</p>
<p>25 Whom God hath proposed to be a propitiation, through faith in his blood, to the shewing of his justice, for the remission of former sins,</p>
<p>26 Through the forbearance of God, for the shewing of his justice in this time: that he himself may be just and the justifier of him who is of the faith of Jesus Christ</p>
<p>27 Where is then thy boasting? It is excluded. By what law? Of works? No, but by the law of faith.</p>
<p>28 For we account a man to be justified by faith, without the works of the law.</p>
<p>29 Is he the God of the Jews only? Is he not also of the Gentiles? yes, of the Gentiles also.</p>
<p>30 For it is one God that justifieth circumcision by faith and uncircumcision through faith.</p>
<p>31 Do we then, destroy the law through faith? God forbid! But we establish the law.</p>
